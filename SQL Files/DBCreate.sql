The loft was super stylish  comfortable  and had all the amenities we could as for.   The location is great.  Alan\'s place is a close walk  to Bree Street and all of the other things in the CBD.  It\'s also conveniently situated in Cape Town where its a cheap Uber ride to other parts of town such as Woodstock  Camps Bay  Clifton  Sea Point  and the VA Waterfront.  And to top it off you have the added benefit of delicious food right outside at the Eastern Food Bazaar. Alan made the entire process painless.  His check-in and check out instruction were thorough and well detailed.  He also provided a guidebook of restaurants and sites to see.

The location was great for a first time visit to Cape Town  as a lot of interesting areas to visit were in waking distance. Waterfront  Table Mountain and Camps Bay were also just a short and cheap taxi ride away. Martin\'s maid Yolandi was also a ROCK STAR. Was so helpful in helping me check in late  as my flight from Paris was delayed 3 hours. But no worry  she helped me with a smooth check in. Comunication was easy with Martin as well  and I really didn\'t have any issues during my stay. It\'s a great place to come home to after a long day of sight seeing. It is also a great place to start the night off  with rooftop drinks before hitting the hottest spots in Cape town on Kloof and Bree street.

Excellent location. Close to everything. Great view of the mountains from the balcony. Bed was small for our needs my partner is 6ft5 so the double bed wasn\'t ideal. We used our stay in Cape Town as \'down time\' on our travels around Africa  I say this only to express that our review is purely based on how the property met our needs  intentions for the time spent there. It\'s with this in mind that the stay was Ok  not great  due to the never ending construction taking place at the hotel directly to the right of the property. So unless you\'re up and out the door by 7 sightseeing all day  expect a lot of hammering  shouting  and constant banging all day. Martin was excellent in his communication and as he\'s abroad was unaware of the construction taking place. Again  just for our personal intentions of getting some RR  we didn\'t find the early morning construction noise a welcome experience. Yolandi is as the reviews say  really lovely. A couple of our messages went unanswered but overall she was lovely. The Property could really use a bath mat as getting up out of the sunken shower when the waters not contained properly could be slippery and hazardous at timesagain just a suggestion. We loved Cape Town and this property really is in a fantastic location. We felt relatively safe. Anyone considering the property for the coming weeks or months should remember there is a lot of construction going on and it doesn\'t stop except for Sunday\'s. Lastly if you\'re visiting in winter  rug up as the property is lofty and can be very chilly  but there are 2 little heaters to take the edge off. Overall a lovely home just a couple things for us personally that didn\'t leave us itching to get back.

The house is actually more beautiful in person than the pictures show  and I thought the pictures were lovely. Stuart is very relaxed  as most of the people we met in South Africa were. He was around to help with any little thing we needed and was also out of sight leaving space for privacy. The housekeeper does live in a space just off the main house and came and went through the house that we rented. It was not a problem at all for us  however if you are looking for total privacy  this may not work for you as there is a modicum of sharing. The bathtubs in both bathrooms were divine for soaking after long days of walking. The location was perfect for a home base for many daily adventures.

The house itself is very spacious and as photographed. We did see the house cleaner and her daughter on a few occasions but they were quiet. Stuart who lives downstairs was very quick to answer our questions and helped us arrange airport transfer so that was fantastic. Only thing that bothered me was the loudness in the loft apartment but it may just be the thinner walls associated with an older house. The gale force winds were much more louder than any noise from other guests. I\'d definitely stay here again if I\'m back in Capetown.

Diane also offered to let us use their laundry washing machine  which we did not find necessary  but the offer was very kind if we had stayed longer.  The apartment does have a drying rack for hand laundry and the breezes off the bay will dry your things quickly.

This turned out to be a wonderful situation with a local tour guide who offered to take us on a private tour all over Cape Town and surrounding area during the days were were there for a reasonable price.  The guide Diane arranged was knowledgeable  accommodating  and very helpful.  He made sure he stayed apprised of local traffic conditions to avoid congestion to make the most of our time in Cape Town.

Gaining access to the property was easy with the instructions given by Mike and Lilliane and they were very available  checking in with us via text to ensure we were situated and comfortable.  There\'s a huge book with advice about activities.  The location is so great that you can park the car at the apartment and walk the city center.

Any problems such as lack of hot water and TV operations were promptly attended too. We thought that the promotion of the apartment is over hyped.

The apartment is clean  modern and centrally located. It has  a very good Wi-Fi service. It is also security wise - quite secure. We were there in Winter and found it to be cold  even with the air conditioner on most of the heat goes up the stair well. The flimsy window curtains do not keep the heat in the room. Whilst watching TV at night we had to have a blanket on. We chose to stay in the compact downstairs bedroom. There are 4 single beds - 2 in the upstairs loft area and 2 downstairs. I slept in the bed near the window and found that there were nights when the air conditioning plant for the building which operates 247 did keep me awake. I then understood why an earlier review mentions that ear plugs could be handy - especially if you are a light sleeper. There is like many other apartments in Cape Town an excellent view of Table Mountain.'),(1428,357793,85086782,'2016-07-10',18787963,'Jensen','We had a lovely 3 nights at this great apartment.

The view was the first thing we noticed. It was great to just relax outside on the balcony and watch the stars. The TV didn\'t work  but we didn\'t bother to contact the hosts because we weren\'t interested in watching TV anyway we had too much to do in the city. The location is great  the markets were walkable  bokaap was walking distance  and long street is walkable. You should be mindful of the path you take  because there are beggars  but if you walk in a group you should be fine. The beds were comfortable  the lower level bedroom was a little bit noisy because some generator sound was constantly running  but I didn\'t mind it felt like a sound machine for me. Bathroom was clean and nice  though it is a little hard to get privacy because the door is a sliding screen that doesn\'t seal. However  the room has a door which you can shut completely. The lofted bedroom has great views and is very spacious. The laundry machine is not very efficient. It takes a while to wash and spin and dry your clothes and you cannot put too much clothes in. It\'s better than nothing though. Overall I loved this place.

First  the location we were less than a 2 minute walk from the following two grocery stores  ATMs  restaurants on the beach road  the beautiful Camps Bay beach  park for kids  etc.  However  as there is a block between the house and all of this but the park  it was quite at night.  As we had a rental  Camps Bay was also a great location to visit all Cape Town locations - from Cape Point to Kirstenbosch to VA.  Even getting to Hermanus was quite easy.  Second  the view  We could see Lion\'s Head from the front yard and the upstairs.  We could also see the 12 Apostles - and I believe the Western Table.  Gorgeous.  Third Virginia the househelp is one of the sweetest people we\'ve met.  Her smile makes you want to smile  She\'s also so helpful if you have any needs and we had very few.  Fourth  the kitchen it was stocked with so much.  We had some good meals in there.  The stovetop is really  really nice.  There were French presses in every room and more to spare in the kitchen.  Fifth it felt more like a house than a hotel.  This was positive for us.  Sixth  it was comfortable from 2 ways of heating each room to the fire place to the couches the AC works great too - if you\'re there when it\'s warm.  Seventh  it had plenty of room for the 11 of us 7 adults and 4 children between the ages of 6-12.  Eighth  the secure parking it was enough for the big Toyota van we drove 10 seater.  That was great  It would be enough for two cars if you\'re not driving a car.  We parked the extra car we were 11 on the road - and there are guys out there who watch the cars.  Ninth washerdryer.  It was confusing because of one review - but there IS a washer and a dryer for clothes and they are large capacity.  Lastly  our hosts  Wow.  From booking to check-out  they were incredible quick to answer any and all questions and I asked a LOT.  They welcomed us with so much fruit  a red and white wine  bread  amazing cake  eggs  and so much more to enable us to eat upon arrival even before grovery shopping.  Keith wanted to make sure I knew where everything was  so walked with me to the two grocery stores and ATMs - which is above and beyond what is required.  One afternoon a window\'s alarm was having issues and Keith left work and came straight away to make sure everything was okay.  They were amazing.  I would love to give more details on this place and it\'s advantages  but it would be so specific that you could easily find the address which would be a privacy issue - and I respect Shirley and Keith too much for that.'),(1799,400107,514519740,'2019-08-21',240309238,'Rhonda','Shirley was awesome She went above and beyond for my family with some of our special requests and needs  and her house is fabulous and its a short walk from the beach and restaurants.

We really enjoyed having a parking lot underneath the building. You can literally reach your car with the elavator from your doorstep. Also  the flat is very large. It was nice to have 2 bathrooms and a lot of room to stow clothes etc. The best thing of course is the huge terrace. When you open the windows  it feels like your living room is a giant balcony with harbour views - esp. breathtaking at night. Communication was fast and easy. But like so often with airbnb flats  there were some issues with the wifi. First  the code was not working - then  even with a functioning code  it was very slow and actually only worked in the sleeping rooms. So if internet is important for you  you should consider this. Also  as indicated in the description  costs for electricity are on top which I found quite unusual  but for 5 days it was just about 3 Euros. However  if you use the aircon  it might be much higher. All in all  I can still suggest staying here. It\'s right in the middle of waterkant village with a lot of great eateries. Don\'t miss burger dinner at Beefcakes with the probably hottest waiters in town Also great Sunday half price sushi in the super-stylish Beluga which is nearby.

He was very friendly and welcoming on that day for one hour  but we did not see him or speak to him again. Based on the description when we\'d booked the room in August  we\'d thought Ian would be our host and that we had booked a room in his home  but this wasn\'t the case. We discovered that the other room in the apartment was also a BB room which had been booked by someone else  and that unlike the other room we didn\'t have a lock on our bedroom door  which made us uncomfortable. Luckily  the other guest left the next day leaving us with the beautiful apartment to ourselves. We would suggest you clarify this detail with Ian  and make sure the room you book can be locked.  The room we booked was at the back of the apartment  which suited us because it is away from the very busy and noisy street at the front where the other room is located. The windows in the back room could use replacing  we had real difficulty sleeping when the neighbours below used their back garden until after 11pm because the sound travelled straight into the room. It seemed that the windows of the room for rent in the front of the building were better insulated and provided more quiet. If you are people who like to stay up late and are not bothered by slight urban noise  this problem could be quite insignificant. The bathroom that comes with this room could also use some renewing BUT the apartment has a fantastic location and we really loved staying there- especially since we had the place to ourselves. The apartment is up a steep set of stairs and would not be suitable for people with mobility problems. We highly recommend this apartment when you  visit Cape Town. It is nicely decorated  has a fantastic deck overlooking the city  and a wonderful central location near the main sights that makes it a FANTASTIC choice.'),(2580,897063,24222471,'2014-12-23',21790392,'Rene','Great place to stay in cape town.

The view from the balcony is quite lovely regardless of the construction across the street. It was noisy but since we were gone most of the day  we hardly noticed it. One thing we did notice was the prayers that were held every morning at 515 due to the proximity to the mosques in the area. We were also given mixed  reviews from locals we interacted with about the area and we were encouraged to use Uber. Uber was inexpensive and quite reliable. I\'m not sure if this is just a general rule for night time activities but we were advised against walking once the sun set in and around this area. During the day we did walk to the market and to a great little breakfast spot across the stairs over the road.

Our host Mario said he would provide a cot and did not mention that there would costs for that. On arrival I asked about the cot and was told that he had forgotten about it  but that another guest had left a cot behind and we could use it without charge for 2 nights and then it would be picked up or we could rent it and pay R 150 per day  which is exorbitant. The house is listed as 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms  sleeps 8. The 4th bedroom is not furnished as a bedroom  it has no closets and the sleeper couch is for 1 person. The 4th bathroom is a guest toilet  not a full bathroom. We booked this property for 2 weeks and all the closets except for 1 in the main bedroom were full. I had to personally remove all the contents of the closets and put the stuff in the garage so that we could hang up our clothes. There were no waste-paper baskets in the bedrooms or bathrooms and we had to regularly fix the flushers of the toilets downstairs. The door of the shower in the main bedroom did not close properly  which resulted in a very wet bathroom floor. The window in the lounge did not lock  so when we left the house we had to lock up all our valuables. The alarm when it went on  was really soft  so did not work either. On both sides of the property there was construction  so we were surrounded by builders and overlooked their outdoor toilet 8 meters away from one of the bedrooms. I understand that this can happen but because we could not lock the house properly we did not feel that our belongings were safe when we were not there and we had little privacy when sitting in the garden. The pool went green  we had no proper instructions and no chemicals to keep the pool maintained. I suggest the owner leave some written instructions as to how to keep the pool properly maintained  especially with all the dust etc  from the construction work on both sides of the property. The worst thing that happened is that we ran out of electricity twice. The owner did not put enough electricity on the card and the second time when I tried to reach him about the problem  he did not answer his emailphone for 2 days. We went and bought elecricity ourselves and Mario said he would reimburse us the R200. However he has not done so and was also not at the check-out at the time agreed  so we left the house without personally handing over the keys and getting the R200 back. We were also not informed by the owner that there would be load-shedding in the area  so on Saturday...'),(3333,669623,25432935,'2015-01-16',14892380,'Charles','We had an incredible time.

We felt like if we stayed in the property for a day it would have felt like being in the countryside instead of the city. Everything is so green  there are birds and its very quiet. That is a funny thing because if you leave the house you will see that its located in one of the hottest areas in Cape Town. The Kloof St is really cool  it has plenty super good restaurants and cafs. We went there for dinner a lot and loved the Kloof Street House. The Long Street  Bree Street are also fun for going out in the evenings and we enjoyed that Olive\'s Cottage was so close to everything. Beside the location  the house and especially the cottage we stayed in were beautiful The interior is just so special and delicate. You can tell that Doreen has a extraordinary taste in design. I would describe it as a mix between relaxed countryside elegance meeting modern scandinavian design. But you can notice the SA influence aswell everywhere which we liked a lot. We loved this creative and special interior Doreen\'s family is just lovely. They made us feel at home and welcome in the very second. The dog and cats who came by from time to time sweetened every day for us. Her husband gave us some great advice for the garden route  The staff was also extremely polite and always helpful. Thanks so much to Robert for helping us and to his lovely wife for the laundry. Special thanks aswell to Doreen\'s daughter who caters the cottages. We never and i mean never had such a good and healthy breakfast Fresh juice with ginger  fruits  eggs  pancakes  bakon  beans ect. - everything you could ask for in the best qualtity. For me one of the definite highlights of our trip And she was very nice too  and at last but not least Doreen herself - she is the perfect host. We felt so comfortable and welcome.

We were however disappointed with our stay. We have only stayed at a couple of Airbnb but all have been far better. In essence the apartment has so much potential. It is in need of modernisation  but despite this there are some small bits that are missing which make all the difference when traveling. They may seem small  but shows the level of thought provided by the owner. With limited space there was no where to put our cases  so design of the apartment could be better. No coat hooks  one old pillow each with 2 old spare ones in the cupboard with no pillow cases  broken garden furniture  old mouldy coffee  no tea bags  no soap powder for the washing machine  no plug socket that the hair dyer provided would work in  small uncomfortable bed  smart tv that had no access to normal channels  no written information for the apartment on how to use equipment or info on the area. Please done fill that I am moaning as the owner was lovely  but if you are expecting to use this as a base for more than a night  you will need to be prepared. The pictures make the apartment look far bigger and feel that it needs a good clean. Sorry to provide such a review  but when making a decision on booking you should be aware of all the facts. If you want a sea view  access to a shared pool  limited space and a lovely location for a couple of nights  then it maybe for you.'),(4476,1333749,405021650,'2019-01-26',83937443,'Gill','This is a great apartment  exactly as described.

In terms of our top reasons why we loved his place 1 central location - it was only a block away from Hop-on-Hop-off bus tours  which is one of the best ways to get around town if you don\'t have a car  it\'s also central and easily walkable to other points of interest such as BoKaap  District 6  and of course Greenmarket Square which is just outside of the door 2 security - the building has a doorman and has a separate key for accessing the building 3 accommodations - there is a relatively large bathroom and we had no problems with hot water  etc.  the kitchenliving space was big with a small balcony facing the main square it would have been a bonus if there was a small sofa to sit on  rather than dining room chairs  the bedroom is relatively large but in the back of the unit...but you aren\'t in Cape Town to sleep  and 4 Connell is an amazing host.
