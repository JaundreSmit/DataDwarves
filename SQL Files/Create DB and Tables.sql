Je kan er bijna alles te voet doen wat gezien het drukke verkeer aldaar heel handig is. Jammer dat het zicht vanop het terras belemmerd werd door een  constructie in aanbouw en dat deze buurt vrij lawaaierig is. Het was wel gemakkelijk en veilig parkeren in de parkeergarage en er was onbeperkt WIFI. Er was ook Netflix maar aangezien ik dit thuis ook kan hebben had ik liever kunnen beschikken over DSTV om naar locale zenders te kunnen kijken. Jean is absoluut een heel vriendelijke  communicatieve en behulpzame host.'),(16259,16395829,'2014-07-27',6786107,'Rob','We had a wonderful experience in the Chambery cottage.  Cheryl was the perfect host  giving attention to all the details  down to having the cozy stove prepared with wood and starter for each evening.  Cheryl\'s breakfasts were fantastic and so complete that we often skipped lunch.  The location is in an upscale suburb  very convenient to the highway into Cape Town  Kirstenbosch Gardens  shopping centers  and also within a short walk to the Main Road where you can find almost anything you need  including a fantastic meat market.  Ample  onsite secure parking for us and our visitors was a big plus.
