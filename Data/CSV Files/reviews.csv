36483,742937,2011-11-25,481352,Amy,Dave Cannon's  house was a tranquil haven  especially after a long plane flight. He was a most kind and thoughtful host The rooms are situated looking out onto a garden with the soft babble of the fountain coming in through the back windows. Very quiet and clean. GREAT location  walk to dining  shops  My City Bus and the beach. I would recommend staying at Dave's house if you are traveling to Cape Town.
36483,2574835,2012-10-10,3052768,Ronny,It was great at Dave's guesthouse.he is a perfect host so helpful and lovely.we started our 6 weeks trip there and we will finish it at Dave's ocean blue guesthouse.highly recommended.ronny ilona
36483,2849463,2012-11-10,3745063,Tom,Dave Cannon was absolutely the perfect host. He was always available when I needed help. The studio's  were very clean and complete. Fabulous beds  bathroom  space to live.. What I liked most about the place was the very relaxed atmosphere. There were possibilities to take your breakfast or meals with other guests  you could relax near the swimming pool  take a drink from the bar and just leave the money in a jar reserved for this. In short the house was fantastic. The neighbourhood was very quiet. The beach a 10 min walk  Capetown 25 min by bus. I wouldn't know what else I could have wished for.
36483,3514625,2013-02-11,2463965,Mark A.,Nice host  nice location. Everything was good.
36483,9702909,2014-01-06,5269881,Lisa,Dave is an easy going  loving life kinda guy which makes your stay so much nicer.  The property itself has 5 roomschalest and a swimming pool that is accessible to all guests. Outside the gate  if you turn left you can reach the beach and numerous restaurants within a 5-7min walk  turn right and within a 5-7min walk you can reach Bayside shopping mall.  Dave's place has an air of peace and tranquility day and night that really helps a person wind down from a stressful life. If you don't have a car you can walk to the mall and pick up a myciti bus and go anywhere you want with ease.
36483,10628955,2014-02-28,9832434,Simon,Very nice and clean rooms and a nice pool area Dave is an always helpful and friendly host and he served us a great breakfast with his self-made muffins
36483,10721450,2014-03-04,11778612,Evi,This studio-suite is exactly as shown and perfect.  Dave is kind and helpful in every way. A most thoughtful host. I certainly would stay with Dave again.  He served a tasty free breakfast on the first day. I enjoyed the pool and the short walk to the beach  revealing a most wonderful view of Table Mountain.  The sunsets on the beach are just beautiful.  Miles of beach to walk upon  but it is way too cold to swim.  The BlowFish is a great fish restaurant on the water and on Sunday nights it is R140 all you can eat Sushi. The bus service is great from town and runs until about 2200 hours to Table View  and another one- stop ride to Popham and then in three short blocks you are safely at home. I always felt safe on my own. If you use the bus and buy MyCiti card  request POINTS instead of value  and add a value of min.R80 and youll receive 20 more  travel for your money.
36483,11160333,2014-03-23,10431561,Barry,Had a lovely stay at Dave's place. Great accommodation and Dave was a perfect host. Suite is great with all you need for a good stay. Pool is good and overall everything is perfect

36485,997191,2012-03-13,1799863,Evan,Dave's home and hospitality far exceeded our wildest expectations.  He and his staff are incredibly welcoming and make the trip to Cape Town even more wonderful.  Dave's breakfast is a great way to start the day and the pool is a nice way to cool off in the evening.  The rooms were neat  clean  safe  private  comfortable  and best of all affordable.  I see no reason to stay at an over priced hotel when staying with Dave is so great

The location is unbelievable for the price  and you cannot put a price on how awesome our few days at Ocean Blue was Dave is a superb host and very hospitable with helping us determine how to navigate the city and tourist attractions  as well as with providing recommendations on places to visit. His homemade muffins put the icing on the cake You will not be disappointed staying here- most likely you will be surprised as to how easy and familiar Cape Town will seem while staying at Ocean Blue.

Easy to access the CBD  southern suburbs  and the surrounding area. The well equipped cottage is situated in a delightful garden  and Brigitte is absolutely the best host.
15007,9223897,2013-12-15,7175290,Morne,We spent a fantastic two week holiday at the Blaauberg house and our guest was phenomenal.  The area is beautiful and very close to the beach with some stunning.  The white house in the picture is actually a great little restaurant less than a minutes walk if you're feeling too lazy to cook.  The house is well equipped and spacious and arranging and leaving was easy and hassle free.  If you're a group this house is excellent value for money.  Thanks again for a wonderful two weeks.
15007,53759983,2015-11-12,13937367,Ciske,Fabulous house in a stunning location The lovely hosts made sure we had everything we needed to ensure a memorable stay.   Great house ideal for a beach holiday for a family  a group of friends.  Amazing sunsets  Thank you very much

15007,68677182,2016-04-06,49795868,Quintas,The location of the house is great with the beach  restaurants and a supermarket within a short walk.  The house is very spacious and a great place to go back in the evening and watch the amazing Cape Town sunset.  Thanks for a great stay.

36499,484744,2011-08-29,939146,Magalie,Lovely location  close to the beach  restaurants and shops. Easy bus access to Cape Town. Room was clean  comfortable  and kitchen very functional. WiFi does not reach the cottage. Also stayed in a suite  which was also really nice and comfortable. Everyone was really friendly and helpful.
36499,864526,2012-01-16,1348050,Hanna,We spent three weeks in the Garden Cottage. The room was perfect for us with a little kitchen and a comfortable bed. We enjoyed using the private garden of the Cottage for our barbecue and summer evenings. Dave and Paul were lovely hosts and they tried to do everything to ensure that we had everything we needed. It was easy to feel welcome. It would have been more than perfect if only the room would have been cleaned every day.
36499,1181503,2012-04-25,2135908,Sunny,We booked this place very last minute and Dave was very accommodating and promptly responded to all our last minute messages. The cottage was clean and comfortable with nice little kitchen and bathroom. Dave was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed. We did not get to see Dave very much since he was leaving Cape Town the very next morning  but we were able to communicate all our needs to Johnathan. The location was also great  we found everything we needed within five minute drive or 15 min walk and it was relatively close to Cape Town center. We definitely recommend this place to everyone.
36499,2452321,2012-09-30,706278,Antonia,Dave was not there for much of the time but kept in the loop and He left a great host very kind and thoughtful. The place is great  very clean with a great pool  garden and water features. It is peaceful and very close to all amenities I did not have a car so that was important to me. 10 mins from  beach and the best view of Table Mountain in Cape Town  Close to buses into town a short walk to resteraunts and shops. When Dave did return he is wonderful......right down to the freshly baked muffins Thanks to you all for making my stay so easy  smooth and above all welcoming Dave you are the best
36499,2719974,2012-10-26,1824709,Elaine,Very pleasant stay - host was exceptionally helpful and thoughtful.
36499,2856846,2012-11-11,1342440,Lionel,I was in Blouberg for kitesurfing and the house is just 5 minutes walk from kitebeach and restaurants. My room was nice and comfortable  a good value for money Dave is a very friendly host. I recommend
36499,2883041,2012-11-13,2874995,Jake,Wonderful stay at Dave's - could not have been happier. Cottage was cozy and comfortable and clean. It's a short walk from the bus stop which makes transportation in and out of Cape Town easy - and far cheaper and quieter than staying outside of the city. The complex is nice  with a decent sized swimming pool and quiet patio area to enjoy food  grilling  etc. Dave made himself readily available and wonderfully amenable. Would come back in a heartbeat.
36499,3048278,2012-12-08,481352,Amy,This is the second time staying with Dave. His house provides a peaceful haven. He is so very warm  and accommodating... any thing he can do for you is no problem. You will enjoy your stay in Cape Town if you stay here
36499,3102331,2012-12-17,1401277,Detlef,Wir haben uns bei Dave sehr wohl gefhlt. Leider war der Freissitz im Garten nur 2 Tage fr uns nutzbar und der Fan nicht in Betrieb. Aber trotzdem hat es uns sehr gut gefallen  insbesondere die nahen tollen Strnde sind auf jeden Fall eine Reise nach Blouwberg wert.
36499,3328020,2013-01-11,4464543,Mauricio,We arrived at about 1am after a delayed drive down the Garden Route and David welcomed us with a smile and warm bedroom. The next day he gave us torches flash lights for our hike up Table Mountain  and some advice on good spots to visit in Cape Town. The room was comfortable and clean. I'd happy stay there again.
36499,4143989,2013-04-14,4042723,Sarah,Dave is an amazing host who bends over backwards for his guests--there's a reason for all the 5 star reviews His place is beautiful and a perfect retreat for the Cape Town area. Now I've just got to figure out a way to get back...
36499,8538158,2013-11-04,8128977,Martina,Stayed 3 nights in the Garden Cottage and liked it a lot  especially the small breakfast treats in the morning. We only meet Dave in the beginning and end of our stay but he is lots of fun and very friendly. Felt safe and welcome in his place.

Highly recommend both apartment and host
36499,27694104,2015-03-09,15732235,Alexandre,Just came home from a truly lovely 3 night stay at Dave's house. The studio was exactly as described and Dave made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We received a warm welcome from Dave upon arrival  and then he took time to take us around to show us the vicinity  nice beaches  nice restaurants  etc. Then he also gave us great advice throughout the stay  and we enjoyed his company and conversation very much. We really felt like friends on visit  We will keep a very fond memory of our stay and highly recommend staying with Dave 
36499,55609616,2015-12-03,46050013,Alice,I enjoyed staying with Dave  he was very welcoming and I felt at home and comfortable at all times. Dave's housekeeper was also friendly. The neighbourhood was pleasant  and the beach was just a short walk away. It was great to be able to run safely along the beach.  There were many restaurants in the area  all within easy walking distance. I also appreciated the privacy and being left alone.
36499,227545780,2018-01-15,21686465,Rose,Dave is the best host ever and he has the best place ever   we had a wonderfull stay at his house  I will definitly  go back here thanks Dave for a wonderfull time

The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures  if not betterThe neighborhood is very conveniently located and although its a lively neighborhood the house is very quiet Would absolutely recommend to stay there

15007,709219469629911138,2022-09-05,28975652,Reid And Chrissie,A really perfect location  and nice comfortable house.  Bed was comfy.  Host very friendly and down to earth.  Can't go wrong here if you're looking for beachfront.  And it was very quiet inside the house  even though the location was right at the waterfront with a restaurant nearby and parking area  etc...   Highly recommended.
15007,765803998368779001,2022-11-22,154090365,Ockert,We had an amazing stay at Dirks place. The house is gorgeous with amazing views and so much to do in the area. Dirk is a awesome host. Will definitely be back

Astrid and Jacques
15007,880259805989059551,2023-04-29,91455180,Kirsten,We booked last minute after our alternative accommodation was not what we expected. Dirk was extremely responsive and met us at the house within 15 minutes. The house is comfortable and we felt very much at home. With views of the beach and car park there was always something interesting to look at and keep us entertained. The sunsets are amazing. We had planned on doing lots in Cape Town but loved the setting so much we spent lots of time at the house just enjoying the beach and braaing. Were so glad we found this house and would certainly stay again.
15007,1038241352629043155,2023-12-03,243886263,Georginia,Thank you Dirk and your wife for wonderful week we could spend in this wonderful house  we feel refreshed and enjoyed every minute.  It was perfect.

15077,3284999,2013-01-06,1489502,Julia,Georg's place couldn't have been nicer.  Rooms are spacious  house is beautiful  and everything you might need and more is there.  A beautiful kiteboardingwalking beach is around the corner  and downtown Cape Town is a short ride away.  It was great to meet new friendstravels from other countries.  And Ellen  who runs the house  is wonderful  We'd definitely stay there again if we found ourselves in Cape Town.
82212,5639319,2013-07-09,6592061,Janine,Gayle was absolutely amazing to deal with - nothing was too much trouble for her.  I rented the apartment for one of our visitors who were thrilled with the location and security.  A few steps to catch the V  A waterfront bus  a walk to the shops and a comfortable stay with all the amenities they needed.  I would definitely put my visitors up in Gayle's flat in the future.
82212,8930842,2013-11-26,9595484,Kern,If you're looking for the perfect beach front apartment for your holiday  this is the spot. Everything is within a 5 min walking distance. The Flat condition is the same you see in the pictures. I had an amazing stay at Gayle's apartment. I'll be back very soon.
82212,10464988,2014-02-20,256867,Liz,Gayle and super cute hubby could not have been more accommodating.  We had a stellar visit at their beautifully remodeled flat right across the street from the beach and the Seapoint pavilion ginormous pool. The breezes were always plentiful..except for 2 days and they brought us a huge fan which did the trick beautifully. The flat is well laid out  has everything you might need...an internet hot spot device that you load from the vodacom store round the corner arrives via helpful Veronica who provides keys  laundry  cleans mid stay etc...there is good security in the bldg and parking if needed. Great cable TV. Seapoint is sort of the midway point between downtown  the waterfront and on the other side amazing Clifton and camps bay. We hiked from Seapoint to camps bay one day...took about 2 hours...them bought a bus pass and zipped all over in the very easy to navigate and cheap clean modern city buses.  This flat is a great value and amazingly well located and your host Gayle responds quickly to any or all concerns.  The amazing la Perla restaurant is 12 block away and we sort of lived there....the other fine dining spot is NV grill and bar above checkers grocery store vodka com also in that plaza about 5 blocks away....firebirds coffee shop and bootleggers bistro also fab....I'm planning on returning to gayle's dreamy spot soon
15077,60453906,2016-01-24,47237179,Alexey,One of the best guest houses for windsurf-addicts in the Mothercity. Extremely pleasant owners GeorgeRomi and housekeeper Ellen. 50 meters from the best spot of the Sunset Beach. High palm tree in the garden is reliable wind meter while you can see the ocean from the balcony  the palm indicates sail size. Good shops in the vicinity. The loft inside is quite stylish and convenient. Will come back again.
15077,79044040,2016-06-10,39273380,Peter,Das Haus ist der Wahnsinn  besonders im Winter  wenn weniger Gste da sind. Die Nhe zum Strand macht sprachlos. Ellen  die gute Seele des Hauses ist eine sprichwrtliche GastMAMA.
15077,120413398,2016-12-10,97204060,Thorsten,Tolle Location  perfekt um seinen Urlaub dort zu verbringen
15077,650533312103040121,2022-06-16,74533177,Sally,Good value accommodation close to the beach and shopping centre  within easy reach of the city centre. We aim to return.
15199,10716180,2014-03-04,1334669,Ian,Alexa has been very welcoming and made the check-in process very simple. The appartment is very well located in Green Point  next to signal Hill and the waterfront  so you are in the center of Cape Town's trendy spot I will be back to this place when I am back in Cape Town Thanks Alexa
82212,12112366,2014-04-23,3479591,Shannon,This was a great spot in beautiful Sea Point. Gayle was very helpful.
82212,21208190,2014-10-13,20461019,Alice,Great location  clean and comfortable  highly recommended place to stay. Thank you.
82212,22691804,2014-11-12,8932732,Serena,The flat is just as described  except I think the couch is slightly different. Nice place  clean  has everything we needed. However we had to pay a deposit for the 3G wireless router and had to buy more data ourselves for the internet. Other than that it was perfect. The place is centrally located  very close to the Waterfront and Camps Bay by car. It's also next to the beach so you can walk along the beach in Sea Point.
82212,25348431,2015-01-13,96716,Stephen,Wonderful apartment in beautiful Seapoint neighborhood.   Apartment exactly as described and maintained in excellent condition.  This well maintained building is right on Beach Road at a prime location across from the pool.  Great communication from owner and helpful doorman and on-site contact.  There is also a Hop-OnHop Off bus stop on the block.    One block from Main Street which offers all the services you might need during a trip.  The Italien restaurant Perla is a great find 1 block away on the beach.
82212,25669604,2015-01-22,11933340,Gwen,Gayle was friendly and easily reachable. We did not manage to meet in person due to our travelling schedule but this did not in any way influence the quality of our stay. Gayle made sure we had a perfect stay at her Beach Front Apartment.
82212,27185013,2015-02-27,11001172,Muriel,The apartment was clean. The room with the double bed is very small. We had several problems during our 5-day stay. Electricity went out twice for longer periods  we had to carry up our luggage 3 floors. And we were out of water for one entire day. The owners were helpful and prompt  the construction close to the apartment wasn't their fault but they could have warned us about it. I would recommend this place only when construction will be concluded. Otherwise communication and booking went smoothly.
82212,28168070,2015-03-19,27138637,Courtney,Gayle's apartment is beautiful and exactly as described. Lovely location in Sea Point  close enough to almost all major Cape Town attractions I had some trouble contacting the housekeeper the morning we were checking in and Gayle was super responsive and took care of everything right away. We were able to drop off our bags and go have lunch while the cleaning was finished  and then check in right at 2. As some other reviewers have mentioned  the bedroom with the double bed is quite small but we managed I was traveling with my parents and sister and all four of us fit comfortably in the apartment. For the price and location you can't beat this place Would definitely stay again or recommend to a friend.
82212,28490550,2015-03-24,28337553,Margaret,The apartment was clean and very nice as described  and convenient to all cape town had to offer.  However the location wasn't as desirable as we expected as construction of the waterfront was underway.
82212,55605634,2015-12-03,15905504,Alexandra,Gayle's flat was perfect for our family holiday. The location is great - on the beach and walking distance to shops and restaurants. The interior of the flat is reflected well in the photos. We would recommend the flats to others looking for a place to stay in Sea Point.
82212,67368212,2016-03-29,44066253,Bradley,The apartment was as per pictures and as per my expectation. It is very comfortable for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids.
15480,40572565,2015-08-01,31090067,Katrina,My boyfriend and I had a great experience in Jean's city bowl apartment. The location is excellent a few restaurants and an awesome coffee shop within a block  and a 10-15 minute walk to the main business and bar areas. Jean was very helpful in providing information about the neighborhood  and in coordinating logistics of arrival and departure. The apartment deck is a bit annoying since there's no real view and people from the upper apartments drop their cigarettes on it. But the building rooftop is gorgeous  including the view from the gym. The gym itself is very limited in terms of machines  but was super convenient to have there to not have to worry about findingpaying fortraveling to somewhere else to exercise. Security in the building is consistent and the main hall lights and elevators still work during loadshedding. Jean is a friendly and generally responsive host  so don't be afraid to call or email him if you need something.

Apartment very central and comfortable with a welcoming basket of coffee tea and rusks. Block was undergoing refurbishment so views from windows were obscured by scaffolding . It was very clean comfortable for three of us but would have been too small for 4 . Would have liked a mirror in the small bedroom . I would recommend this apartment.

82212,798529822222146810,2023-01-06,31108331,Sara,Gayle is one of the most gracious and patient hosts I have come across in my many years using air bnb  her place is perfect and accommodating and in an amazing location on the seafront. Unfortunately  I was no longer able to stay at her place as intended  however  I will be sure to stay there when I am back in Cape Town. Despite having to cancel shortly after arriving  I must say  the check in was smooth and easy to understand and the staff assisting were very helpful. The apartment had every you'd need and more and everything is clearly explained. I recommend hiring the scooters near seapoint and driving around on them to camps bay as the sunsets Thank you for your hospitality Gayle

96036,771709,2011-12-08,260871,Vince,Not only was capetown an amazing destination  but Christan's house in the green point district exceeded my expectations.  The location is very convenient  quiet and safe.  The house is equipped with everything you need for a comfortable and stylish stay.  Christan was easy to work with in organizing arrival details and he has a terrific list of things to do  see  eat and or hang out in the surrounding area.  The place was a refreshing alternative to a hotel and comes highly recommended.
96036,836904,2012-01-04,1369374,Andy,In a word Perfection. This place was everything the review said and more This house is perfectly located in a safe neighborhood  within walking distance to a great many bars and restaurants as well as beaches and grocery stores. As if the location weren't enough  the house could and probably has be on the cover of any high-end home design magazine in any country. It's THAT AWESOME The owners were beyond accommodating for our group of four  giving us great recommendations for our New Years Eve celebrations and even leaving some great creature comforts like a bottle of wine for us to enjoy. If we ever make it back to Cape Town  you can bet the first thing well do  even before buying our airline tickets  is to check and see if this Beautifully Unique Town House is available for the duration of our stay. Stay here and you will not be disappointed
96036,3161048,2012-12-27,590390,Ying,We had a fantastic stay at Christan's beautiful Green Appartment. The location
96036,24405645,2014-12-28,21086021,Sureka,We had a lovely stay at Christan's place.  He made our arrival and departure easy and seamless and left us tons of very useful information about the area and Cape Town in general.  Even though this wasn't our first visit to Cape Town many of Christan's recommendations for places to eat or visit were new for us and we enjoyed them totally.  The town house itself is great and fabulously decorated and includes all the amenities one would need.  The location was also great and within walking distance of the V and A  coffee shops and restaurants.  We would certainly recommend this place to others looking for a place to stay in Green Point.
96036,25006855,2015-01-05,5267715,Stephanie,Christan's flat is an absolute gem He and his partner clearly have impeccable taste that walks a perfect line between beauty and function.  Christan is an incredibly thoughtful host and we were welcomed with a bottle of bubbly for New Years and Nespresso coffee pods for the week.    We had a wonderful stay in Cape Town. I would highly recommend Christans flat for anyone traveling to Cape Town.
96036,125156829,2017-01-04,524086,Dominique,Christan's home is stunning and completely unique- it even wowed our friends from Cape Town when they came over for drinks. Christan made our stay very straightforward  with great communication and loads of lovely touches like a bottle of wine and Nespresso pods. The surrounding area is lovely too  with great delis and cafes and an easy walk to the sea front. I can't wait to come back
96036,220398172,2017-12-22,3433491,Lauren,We had a wonderful stay here. The apartment is absolutely stunning. Everything is clean and well kept. Christans communication is fast.

96036,223938522,2018-01-02,21239187,Michael,Christians apartment is lovely with very high ceilings and ornate period details  eclectic stylish furnishings and lots of artwork.  The kitchen is large and well equipped so if you cook while on holiday this place is for you.  The location is ideal  about midway between the beaches and city centre so easy access to both  and shops and cafes of Main Road are a short walk.  One caveat  the curtains are sheers so if you like to sleep in a dark room you  will struggle.
96036,225990217,2018-01-08,3591692,Camille,The apartment was simply perfect for us. Superb location  very stylishly furnished. Christian is a very pleasant and courteous contact. Unfortunately  we didn't get to know him personally  but the exchange by e-mail was always fast  uncomplicated and charming. On our next visit to Cape Town we will be happy to book the apartment again. Oh yes thanks for the bottle of white wine
96036,585076687,2019-12-31,3295806,Kate,Had An amazing stay at Christans. Great location close to the city and the beaches. Super clean and amazing interiors.

96036,538906745080482233,2022-01-13,30760225,James,This is what airbnb is all about. Staying in someones home and having an experience no hotel can offer.

15480,620405771,2020-03-22,194254634,Dominique,Gezellige en nette flat op een goede locatie met winkels en restaurants vlakbij in het centrum van Kaapstad. Je kan er bijna alles te voet doen wat gezien het drukke verkeer aldaar heel handig is. Jammer dat het zicht vanop het terras belemmerd werd door een  constructie in aanbouw en dat deze buurt vrij lawaaierig is. Het was wel gemakkelijk en veilig parkeren in de parkeergarage en er was onbeperkt WIFI. Er was ook Netflix maar aangezien ik dit thuis ook kan hebben had ik liever kunnen beschikken over DSTV om naar locale zenders te kunnen kijken. Jean is absoluut een heel vriendelijke  communicatieve en behulpzame host.
15480,616398795613539995,2022-04-30,91410289,Drikus,Cozy little flat located in one of the best areas to explore Cape Town from. The location is 90 of the appeal here. The flat works well for couples. We stayed there for a month without experiencing any real issues  some areas of the flat does need to a good spring clean but I'm sure that will be sorted before the next guests check in.
15480,700546003023194378,2022-08-24,214953694,Samuel,The flat's description is very accurate and the communication with Jean is always easy . The neighbourhood is very central   right in the heart of Zonebloem next to Cape Town CBD. I definitely recommend 
15704,837489395585047776,2023-03-01,479994034,Olu,The best villa I have stayed at  Great experience
16259,16395829,2014-07-27,6786107,Rob,We had a wonderful experience in the Chambery cottage.  Cheryl was the perfect host  giving attention to all the details  down to having the cozy stove prepared with wood and starter for each evening.  Cheryl's breakfasts were fantastic and so complete that we often skipped lunch.  The location is in an upscale suburb  very convenient to the highway into Cape Town  Kirstenbosch Gardens  shopping centers  and also within a short walk to the Main Road where you can find almost anything you need  including a fantastic meat market.  Ample  onsite secure parking for us and our visitors was a big plus.  Chambery is a warm and inviting BnB that is very professionally run and we highly recommend it.
96036,793305183739222039,2022-12-30,7280176,Matthew,Christian's massive apartment is incredible. It's a place you will remember for its style  taste and books. We loved it.

101292,3761147,2013-03-12,3704899,Manisha,Muizenburg is such a fun suburb and Simric and Careys place is ideally situated  a short walk from the beach and lots of great restaurants and cafes nearby.

We loved our stay here and can't wait to be back

It is also a great location with easy access by car to the city and surroundings.  Our only regret is that we didn't have a little more time to enjoy the pool
16259,59194561,2016-01-08,41568820,Lyn,Cheryl was a most welcoming host  very helpful with local advise and a really lovely lady. The accomodation was perfect and exactly as described  we had the loft room which was a great hideout after a busy day exploring. The pool was a great luxury to have use of  especially after a hot day at cricket In Newlands. The dogs were so friendly and lovely to fuss but are never intrusive  it felt a real home from home. The neighbourhood was well kept and very pleasant. A beautiful place to stay with stunning garden and easy access to Cape Town centre and surrounding areas. Highly recommend.

The place is fitted and maintained to a high standard and managed in a low-key manner that suited my needs as a non-tourist traveller. It is located in a beautiful suburb  close to the highway that leads to downtown Cape-Town and is within walking distance of Cavendish Square Mall and the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens.

19271,10086653,2014-01-29,10594897,Karine,Thank you so much for our stay Beverley. We stayed here as part of our honeymoon. We enjoyed staying here so much we booked it again for our last night in Cape Town after traveling up the Garden Route. Beverley was so kind and full of tips on where to eat  shop  and visit. She even provided recommendations for places to visit along the Garden Route. The place was lovely and the most welcoming sight after a long transit. It was extremely clean flowers even decorated the table  very comfortable  and located in a beautiful neighborhood adjacent a park walking distance from the botanical gardens. The amenities were perfect as we were able to do a load of laundry  park securely  and even cook ourselves a full meal in the kitchen. We were so lucky to have been guests in such a perfect place. After our stay here we have sworn off standard hotels forever. AirBnB is such a perfect way to travel. Thank you again Beverley for making out stay in Cape Town a great experience We hope to see you again someday

The sounds of birds  visits from sweet cats  a friendly dog were always welcomed and the bathtub was especially luxurious

19271,11865900,2014-04-17,13376002,Pippa,Beverley's self catering suite is really clean and comfortable and was perfect for me for my visit to Cape Town. Beverley is friendly and made me feel safe and welcome. She is also knowledgable about her home city.  She very kindly helped me settle in and orientate myself for this my first visit to Cape Town. My son was over on Rugby tour with his school and Beverley's accommodation is well placed for the three schools where the matches were held and where he was staying with a host family.  I would not hesitate to recommend Beverley's place to an individual or couple looking for a base from which to explore or do business in the stunning city of Cape Town.

The house is located in a quiet and safe residential area  it is very tidy and fully equipped  very close to the beach by foot and some nice sea view restaurants. From the yard you can actually see the beach. The owners showed great hospitality and were very accommodating. I would recommend it to anyone

We did not miss anything. The apartment is lovingly furnished and has everything you need. We were welcomed with wine and champagne. The view to the sea and the sunsets are indescribably beautiful. From the apartment you could see if the wind wind is coming and in only 2 minutes by car we were at the kitebeach. Very close to there are many good restaurants and in about 30 minutes by car uber  taxi  bus... we were at the middle of Capetown. Best wishes and hopefully soon again. From Switzerland Gianni and Fabian

106673,228818219,2018-01-21,23425824,Tobias,We spent 3 weeks at Omega 4. Helena and Mike are lovely hosts They are there for the guests 24  7 and do everything that you have a great time in Cape Town.

106673,1078929439580413911,2024-01-28,87868799,Ferran,Los propietarios muy simpticos y agradables  pero la ubicacin no es la que pone en Airbnb  lo muebles no son lo que pone la foto ni tampoco lo que se describe  el alojamiento muy viejo y remarco MUCHO RUIDO DE MOTORES. Por eso tube que pedir a Airbnb de cambiar el lugar durante mi instancia de Cape Town. Por ultimo muy caro para lo que es.
106673,1089034047765007461,2024-02-11,506978555,Ty,If you are looking for a cheap and convenient option with good service  this is the place. However  take note  it is an old place. That means old furniture  TV  appliances. bedding  towels etc. The location is great for its price. If you are looking for a spot close to beach and restaurants in a safe neighborhood at a very affordale price choose this. If you want luxury beachfront accommodation  go somewhere else and pay more. Side note  the hosts are great people and wonderful hosts.
114218,828479,2012-01-03,7145,Andrea,Incredible and breathtaking would be two words although by all means not all I could use to describe Oliver's place. The house is probably more open plan than the pictures suggest which is a good thing.  And the views are absolutely incredible. I don't think the photos do the house and location any justice It is breathtaking. I never got to meet Oliver and his family as they were away when we myself  my parents and sister and parents-in-law stayed at their house but I can fully vouch for how friendly and helpful Oliver was. And I can't stop raving about the place. It was so comfortable in Oliver's tastefully decorated house that we had the best time imagineable Oliver and family  I would love to stay at your place again and meet you and your family And I would definitely recommend this place to fellow travellers who are coming to Cape Town
114218,3184506,2012-12-30,1352236,Nicole,We spent an extremely pleasant week in Capetown in an amazing villa. The house was very well equipped everything was clean and tidy ready to host a family of five. The view at night is simply jaw dropping and the kindness and efficiency of its owner were greatly appreciated. The area was safe  beautifully green and so close to the Table Mountain...we couldn't have dreamed of a better villa for our family holiday in Capetown. Many thanks to Oliver and his family who were so eager to make our holiday the best ever and answered every question we had or every email we sent so quickly and so efficiently.
114218,3285807,2013-01-06,1512162,Kathleen,The pictures don't lie the house is supurb. Check in and out easy and fast. Oliver a helpful host. Magical moments were enjoyed under the mist floating off the mountain. The pool was shallow enough to be a good temperature for swimming. Thanks for a great stay  my 6 friends and I all want a home just like this
19271,132310350,2017-02-17,178509,Marie,Beverly's guest cottage is a great place to base yourself for your time exploring Cape Town. It's nicely decorated and though it has just a small kitchen  I was pleasantly surprised at how well equipped it was. She's a quick drive to the CBD and airport and within walking distance of shops and restaurants in Newlands and Claremont. You'd never know it  though  because her house is set along the tranquil Liesbeek River. I would definitely stay at Beverly's again.
19271,137406725,2017-03-15,110491274,John,A lovely place to stay  close to everything. Beverly is a great host  she even got up to say goodby at 630 in the morning.

19271,197692758,2017-09-26,128672138,Marlene,What excellent accommodation  Very quiet and peaceful and very clean.  The kitchenette was well stocked with tea  coffee for the plunger as well as instant coffee  rusks  granola and bran flakes.  The fridge had juice  fresh milk and yoghurt.  Two muffins were in our unit for the first morning and crumpets were provided for the following two days. Highly recommended

The location is superb and I enjoyed the trail and demarcated running areas. Restaurants are walking distance and you can come back and really relax at a spacious room with all the amenities you can think of. Thank you again and look forward to the next stay.
19271,328104782,2018-09-25,80441827,John,Beverley's accommodation is great value - spotlessly clean and  comfortable  quiet and peaceful  with excellent amenities  a full DStv bouquet  adequate wifi and secure parking. It is centrally located in the southern suburbs  with quick access to shopping  restaurants  and my favourite walks along the Liesbeek River.
114218,58259746,2016-01-02,33753218,Linda,Oliver made us feel very welcome and provided all the information that we needed. The house was in a very beautiful part of CapeTown and very convenient for all the attractions that were literally just a few minutes away. The views  from the house were amazing and the house itself was very spacious and well fitted out. The house was very secure with private parking and locked gates.  We had a splendid time.  Ideal for families or large groups.
19271,415310164,2019-02-22,48031721,Ulrike,Beautiful place  very accessible and lovely hosts

114218,440768941,2019-04-21,33192643,Frank,...ein wunderschner Ort zum Wohlfhlen
114218,581185232,2019-12-24,59640868,Kirsten,This house is a gem. The location is perfect hunched up on Kloof Nek  between the Camps BayClifton side and downtown Cape Town. The style of the house is amazing. It is really beautifully decorated and special. It feels like you want to live there and as if it were your home. I am allergic to dust  so the furniture and few carpets gave me some allergy. But that would not bother normal customers. Oliver is amazingly easy to reach and was outstanding in making sure we had all we need and are greeted immediately on arrival.
114218,588898636,2020-01-05,194517320,Tobias,Oliver war ein perfekter Gastgeber  alles war unkompliziert und die Kommunikation jederzeit extrem schnell. Das Haus war sensationell und genauso wie beschrieben  fr uns eine perfekte Lage die Aussicht atemberaubende und sicher unvergessliche. Wir werden bei unserem nchsten Trip sicher wieder hier buchen.

19271,566646575,2019-11-20,114014682,Rianne,Beverley's place was a delightful  cosy self catering room. The position is excellent and we loved our walks along the Liesbeek River  which started on her doorstep. Hard to believe that it can be so peaceful and yet one is in the centre of a lovely shopping area. Beverley went the extra mile always surprising us with a tea time treat.
19271,568156130,2019-11-24,258356464,Richard,Wonderful facility and hospitality. Very helpful host
19271,569620438,2019-11-27,255183157,Michelle,There are numerous places to stay in Cape Town.  This was our second visit to Cape Town and once again we chose to stay at Largo House.  We love this place  in part  due to its proximity to Kirstenbosch Gardens.  Thanks again Beverley.
19271,581958899,2019-12-26,226803664,Paula,Beverleys spot  was immaculate  central and finished with welcoming and homely touches. I cant wait to come back  thank you so much  Beverley

19271,598449116,2020-01-27,4369146,Andrew,Bevs place is right up at the top among the dozens of Airbnb places I have stayed at. The location is ideal  and not just because of the proximity to Newlands cricket stadium. It is also a really nice leafy road  next to a little park and with a view of the mountain. I have a preference  too  for the arrangement here  where you are in a separate building in the garden  it means everyone gets their privacy. The main room is really spacious and the kitchen is very well equipped. I would definitely come here again when I next visit Cape Town.
19271,615109783,2020-03-07,212577139,Tlalane,I loved staying here. The host is very friendly and welcoming. The space is peaceful and beautiful. I totally recommend it.

19271,672875934,2020-10-10,363039461,Takalani,The place is beautiful  but we had a serious miscommunication with the host and she was a bit harsh.
19271,700834334,2020-10-16,6173192,David,Great self catering accommodation. Beverley is a great host  the supplies of coffee  mild  fruit and cereals is much appreciated  and makes settling in so easy. Newlands is a magnificent part of Capetown.

122455,540321407942717535,2022-01-15,65115297,Andreas,The Yellow House has been a fabulous home for our family of five three girls and a small dog. We came here for work and have spent 5weeks incl. Xmas and New Years Eve. The house is perfectly suited for families who enjoy the waterfront  running signal hill or even just spend a day shopping at VA Mall. The large garage was just perfect for our baggie Toyota Hilux  double cab and the small pool good to cool down on hot days. It is spacious enough for families even though we have spent most of the time outside  with work  travels. The owner ist amazing - very responsive and Dylan is lovely and very supportive on all requests weve had. Thank you again for a perfect stay in Cape Town  Green Point
122455,555571271268616272,2022-02-05,112629,Alexander,Great House - great location. Easy communication. I would love to come back sometime soon

122455,580903389738613994,2022-03-12,283066,Alexandra,Super Haus in absoluter Bestlage. Easy lifestyle in Cape Town. Durch die erhhte Lage am Berg hat das Haus einen rundum Traumblick auf Meer und Stadt. Cafes und Retsaurants sind schnell fulufig zu erreichen. Die Kche ist gut ausgestattet  falls man sich entscheidet - trotz des riesigen Angebots an Weltklasse-Restaurants  - eine  gemtlichen Abend zu Hause auf der Terrasse zu verbringen und den Schiffen auf dem Meer zuzuschauen. Sehr ruhige und sichere Strae  wir haben sogar meistens das Auto einfach vor dem Haus auf der Strae geparkt  trotz gerumiger Doppelgarage mit direktem Zugang zum Haus. Alles in allem eine gerumige und moderne Unterkunft mit Terrasse und kleinem Pool und spektakulrer Aussicht Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder
122455,585287327159309453,2022-03-18,2634458,Jane,I really enjoyed the stay. The host was very nice and made me feel very welcome. The house is very yellow and has its quirks fan switch in the cupboard. It was comfortable and the views spectacular.

Its a nice neighbourhood with a great location  close to both the city and the waterfront. Four bedrooms. Perfect for families or a group of friends.

It was a really great home. Lets just highlight that for some young child before 3 some stairs are not protected so just to consider that point of you come with kids. We slept fantastically there

Throughout the whole stay we were supported by him and his local contact person Dylan and all our questions were answered within minutes. The house itself is a design heaven and the location is quite and safe. Few things in the kitchen could be updatedfixed. 100 recommendation
122455,822334734134430767,2023-02-08,261206988,Daniel,Fr uns eine perfekte Unterkunft in einer super Gegend mit Wahnsinns Aussicht wir wrden liebend gerne wieder kommen 
122455,836820259081912340,2023-02-28,5471958,Christiana,I really recommend the Yellow house and in particular its host dylan. we were met with great flexibility concerning check-in and check-out times and when we accidentally damaged the wifi modem  dylan even gave us his own mobile one. The real cherry on top of the frosting were his stories about capetown in the 80s -. the house has an incredible sunset and oozes character with its yellow elements. its also complete noise-free and you do not even notice there is neighbours on the terrace. loadshedding ofcourse still salts the game a bit in capetown  but during our stay they added a wifi connection that keeps on running. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
122455,849055634902482648,2023-03-17,377734677,Leon,Great location with beautiful views All and all a lovely place.

19271,743972879,2021-03-31,390779485,Luke,I immensely enjoyed my stay at 9 Largo Road. The courteous and kind hosts made me feel welcome  responded quickly  and took good care of me. The house is excellently situated close enough to the amenities of Cavendish that one can walk even at night  and close enough to town that theres no difficulty in getting Ubers  but in a quiet and green neighbourhood that feels safe. I highly recommend a stay here
19271,755028696,2021-05-04,8320238,Samantha,Beverley hosted my in-laws when they came to visit Cape Town. They couldn't stop raving about their experience and will definitely stay there the next time they come. Thank you Beverley

The kitchen was very well equiped  with everything we needed  even more. The room is very spacious and has a cute backyard to sit outside. Check inout and communication was easy going and super uncomplicated. We enjoyed our stay very much and can highly recommend Largo House.
19271,575174548691356218,2022-03-04,138097716,Allison,Largo House was perfectly located and offered all that we required. Beverley was a superb host.
123012,879945,2012-01-23,768298,Marleen,There's only one word to describe this hideaway AMAZING. Doreen and Meyer I hope I'm spelling this right are wonderful hosts  welcoming and fun  and their sense of style blew me away. We had a great weekend here. Inside  it feels like an oasis with the lush garden and the swimming pool while bustling bars and some of the greatest shops and restaurants are literally around the corner. The property is located right in the heart of one of the nicest neighborhoods in town. I can highly recommend staying here  great value for money. And don't let the fact that there are dogs hold you back Sophie and Jinja are the cutest We'll definitely come back here. - Kim  Marleen
123012,1116351,2012-04-12,1959231,Nadeem,Amazing location  amazing host and a beautiful home. Wouldn't stay anywhere else if back in Cape Town.
123012,2536812,2012-10-08,1534297,Brbara,Doreen's estate is beautiful and well located. The Studio in itself is furnished with exquisite taste and has its own entrance so you can have the desired privacy. Doreen was very welcoming and helpful with tips for Cape Town  as was Robert  who also lives in the estate and made sure that I had and knew everything i needed to have a good stay in Cape Town. Two days were not enough for Cape Town  so i definitely will aim to return soon and hopefully be able to stay at The Studio again. I recommend you do the same
123012,3904027,2013-03-26,4619437,Ina,Our stay in The studio was amazing. Doreen really created a little really nice and classy Oasis. We enjoyed everything - the place itself and its surrounding the garden and the area in Cape Town its classy style. And it was a pleasure to meet Robert and everyone who worked there. We also felt very save. So we would love to visit again -
123012,4105589,2013-04-10,565775,Nancy,Best part of stay  was fabulous hospitality from Doreen  her husband  daughter and Robert who helps make it all work.  Small efficiency apt that works fine...we cooked there and used some herbs generously offered by Doreen from her raised beds garden.
123012,4279869,2013-04-24,565775,Nancy,Once again Tom and I loved our stay at Doreen's  this time in The Olive Room  which we truly appreciated for it's spaciousness  decor and overall pleasing furnishings--especially the pottery dishes.  Would like a set for home.  Doreen's daughter Jade  so fun to talk food with and only wish was there longer so we could cook together.
123012,4521318,2013-05-10,5637072,Karen,We had the pleasure of staying in the Studio for 3 nights in May. First off I have to say that Robert could not have done anymore for me - he was willing to sort out internet when there were connection issues  his wife helped with laundry and there was safe off street parking provided when asked. As hosts  I would highly recommend Doreen and Robert. The Studio is perhaps more suited to 1 person as the bathroom space is a bit odd - however  it is beautifully decorated and a lovely space with all amenities necessary. Location wise it is super easy as well but be warned Camp street is very busy and a bit noisy
19271,591058561775571589,2022-03-26,52426467,Debbie,What a fabulous place to stay Beverley made us feel at home We had so many lovely treats- fresh fruit  yogurts  crumpets  a whole selection of cereals. Bev's place is situated in such a convenient position- close to main shops. The bed was so comfortable  There was  plenty of space in the unit  a seating area outside plus such a lovely small  kitchen with everything you need. Thank you again we will be back
123012,8990879,2013-12-01,5873903,"Robyn, Chris  Thandi",Staying in the studio has been a dream come true. It is such a gorgeous  happy  bright space in a great part of town. Minutes away from everything you could possibly need - my lack of a vehicle hasn't been a problem at all. Doreen and the family have been so so lovely to me. I really can't say enough good things about this place. The last 3 months have been so special and I would definitely recommend staying here to everyone
123012,10462351,2014-02-20,4863758,Dick,Great stay with Doreen and her family The studio is set in a lush garden with access to use of a pool  mountainbikes and garden. Sharing the garden with the normal occupants  4 ducks  2 cats and 2 dogs Sophie and Jinja  made it even feel more homely The studio is perfect for a couple or 2 singles  and nicely situated between Kloof and Kloofnek street. Doreen  Robert  and the other people in the house were very helpfull with info on good restaurants  letting us store the luggae during the day  and with getting some washing done. I can without a doubt recommend Doreen's studio  and we look forward to coming back soon
123012,10755752,2014-03-06,8893070,Johanna,This place is just WOW. You literally feel the love for design and beautyfull things at this place. Everything in this tiny little appartment is planned very smart and equipped with lovely details. Beautyfull garden  amazing hosts. Very relaxing atmosphere...
123012,10996097,2014-03-16,3628065,Helen,Doreen has a beautiful home and we were v lucky to get to stay there in the Cottage. It was very tastefully decorated and we had a wonderful stay in a very central location of the city. highly recommended.
123012,11172359,2014-03-24,2016878,David,Our stay at Doreen's property was just perfect. We spent 4 days at Olive's Cottage and 4 more at The Studio and both places are beautifully decorated with lots of light and great views. The whole property is amazing. It is located in our favorite part of Cape Town  just around the corner of Kloof Street  with tons of restaurants and bars to choose from. We really loved it there and we hope to go back soon
123012,11793542,2014-04-15,8733775,Emelie,Wonderful place  lovely hosts It's the perfect place to stay in Capetown
123012,17750479,2014-08-17,14045636,Zhanna,This accommodation is the best if you are going to Cape Town Beautiful house  great owners  amazing Table mountain's view It was the best time of my life with you during 2 months Thank you  Doreen and  of course  thanks my big friend Robert I live every my day in CT I miss you  my dear friends 
123012,20650274,2014-10-03,12943837,Tigest,The host was great and welcomed me with great treats for my first night.  The place was very clean and and in a safe and accessible location.
123012,24249473,2014-12-23,5318347,Ali,Doreen and Robert created a wonderful home away from home for us. The studio apartment is chic and cosy  and the grounds which it's nestled within have the most beautiful views up Table Mountain  and is located gloriously close to the bars  restaurants and shops of Kloof and Long street. Also worth mentioning that the pool provided glorious relief from the beautiful Cape Town sun. Finally  I'd like to say thank you to everyone at In Awe Stays for our lovely engagement present. It certainly was a holiday we won't forget  and we hope to visit again
123012,26331202,2015-02-09,21346825,Dan,Doreen  Robert  Jade and all others were really welcoming. We loved our stay here Great compound  lovely atmosphere and nice pool. We were allowed a late check out which was vey helpful. We did bring our eye masks - the white curtains let a lot of light through. The toilet is right behind one bed so if you like your privacy you've got to ask the other person to ehm leave the room for a bit - Overall would recommend a stay here  anywhere at the compound would be great
19271,595424950102985724,2022-04-01,74758979,Janine,Loved my short stay.  So beautifully appointed and perfectly situated.  Will definitely be back.

19271,626574182006060125,2022-05-14,4245508,Jennifer,My stay in Newlands with Beverley was warm  welcoming  beautifully positioned in a quiet alcove with stunning views of Table Mountain. Everything was perfect Shops  restaurants were within walking distance as was access to the Liesbeek River that runs gently through the reserve just across the road. Beverley is a genuine Super Host  made me feel like a family friend rather than a visitor. Absolutely recommended

She makes the  stay even more special with her added touches such as fresh fruits  yoghurts  cereals. It is spotlessly clean with a  huge comfortable bed.

19271,775148257827524013,2022-12-05,87183267,Heila,Largo House most certainly ticks all the boxes. Not much passing traffic  offstreet parking and the accommodation just fabulous. We particularly enjoyed that the apartment was freestanding with a patio outside the entrance. This accommodation would be highly recommend if you enjoy simple elegance  cleanliness and a host and hostess in attendance without being overbearing.

123012,63333860,2016-02-22,25743273,Daniel,Since we fell in love with Doreen's place last year we were so looking forward to get back. This year it has been exactly as nice  friendly and beautiful as we remembered it  this is the place to stay when in CPT because it's a little green family paradise in the middle of the city  walking distance to our fav streets like Kloof and Bree Street. The only sad thing is that Jade her daughter is not catering the cottages anymore  we were really missing her fabolous food But since there are so many sweet breakfast cafs and restaurants we got over it  we will always come back Thank you so much Doreen  family and her lovely staff who are super nice and always helping.
19271,1016511717214498220,2023-11-03,167219707,Meg,Beverly is a great hostess who goes out of her way to make a visit comfortable and homely.

123076,390907,2011-07-23,748464,Jomandie,I urgently needed a nice place in Cape Town for a weeks stay with my three dogs and found Garden Cottage whilst googeling around. From the moment go  this place just looked amazing and in reality it was more than amazing. Its stylish decor took my breath away and it was the small things like heated flooring  electric blankets and the fact that they serviced and cleaned the cottage daily really added to an amazing stay. I also found the owner and her staff warm and inviting and they would drop everything at a hat to help us get set up on internet or whatever we needed during our stay. The gardens are beautiful and stylish laid out giving one a real breather from the hustle and bustle of the city. I give this place a full five stars and can recommend it to anyone that wishes to visit the mother city and like to avoid hotels but doesnt want to miss out on the services it offers.

The check-in and check-out were super smooth and personal  the house was perfectly in order and taken care of throughout our stay  we had everything we needed including the little extras like a sunbrella  cooking books  and a BBQ for your summer braais that we were so excited to make use of. Ingrid checked in and took care of whatever we needed regularly. The neighborhood is so pretty and calm  the house is full of light  and the two terraces are perfect for dinners  reading  and relaxing. Parking is always available in the street  the location of the house is super convenient for anything you might want to head out and do in and around Cape Town  and we were truly sad to leave. We highly recommend you stay at Ingrid's place when in town

Everything is very comfortable  well equipped and designed  the room was exquisit. Alice is a very warm and welcoming person  she gave us so many good advices what to do and where to go  or better not  around cape town. We would do it again anytime.
133339,9288061,2013-12-18,694254,Cindy,Alice was very nice  even when we forgot our keys on a Saturday night Nice location  close to many good restaurants and an easy walk to the center of town.
133339,9543461,2014-01-02,2012291,Christian,Alice home is very nice- it is as described on Airbnb. It is so lovely and we really loved the area. There are a couple of good restaurants and especially the cafes on Kloof street are so good to start the day Also a plus is that you can easily park your car.

133339,10173176,2014-02-04,8447476,Hayley,We would stay here again. Lovely house and host in an amazing part of Cape Town
133339,10304010,2014-02-11,2708876,Tom,Alice house is very nice  we had a pleasant stay and a very nice room.
133339,10600061,2014-02-27,8712659,Paul,The room was clean  very comfortable and exactly as described  with an en-suite shower room and toilet the bed gave a good nights rest. My host Alice gave good directions to get to the house  which is situated near the top of Kloof Street in a pleasant neighbourhood. She met me when she said she would and was on hand if I needed anything. Having visited Cape Town many times my needs were few  but I feel sure that Alice would have been able to give suggestions and recommendations of things to do and places to go if need be. Alice gave me her mobile for emergencies  explained the security aspects which are not tedious and generally just let me get on with my stay without being in the way at all. The terrace is very relaxing to sit out on and enjoy the birds and the plants. Would stay again if travelling on my own. All in all a nice location  as the distance to the beaches of Camps Bay and Clifton are 10 minutes over the hill by car  and the Waterfront for retail and culinary therapy are the same distance the other way  down the hill. Plenty of local places to eat breaksfast-brunch-lunch just down on Kloof Street Manna  Milano  Liquorice  Lime  Knead. A short dirve away to Montrose is Carluccis  with good outdoor space and a fabulous view of the mountain while you eat breakfast.
133339,10740058,2014-03-05,4009501,Zosia,Constantia Villa added a taste of luxury to our Cape Town visit. It was a peaceful  cool  clean  beautiful haven to return to after long days out exploring. Alice is a very accommodating host and made us feel very welcome. We'll certainly recommend Constantia Villa to friends and family.
22994,55022,2010-06-20,101615,Danny,Beautiful house  great hosts  amazing location with everything Cape Town has to offer a short trip away
22994,25161092,2015-01-08,18674879,Ciara,Thank you to Sandra and Barry for making the first stop on our South African adventure so amazing. The house is fantastic  the pictures don't do it justice. Sandra and Barry were available at a moments notice  their neighbours were so helpful as we'll as their house cleaner Thembi Special mention to the dogs Milligan and Sophie  fantastic pets and guard dogs We were all sad to say goodbye to the heritage home in Rondebosch
22994,38270557,2015-07-14,32616995,Carol,It was a pleasure to work with Sandra while I was organizing our holiday and she went the extra mile to ensure we had everything we needed  from providing a toy box for my two year old nephew to excursion suggestions. My brother and his family arrived a few days before we did and were warmly greeted by Sandra and her family and helped to settle in. Their beautiful home was exactly as we expected  perfect for our two families and very comfortable - a home away from home. We loved looking after the two adorable dogs  Milligan and Sophie  Kai the cat and the chickens  and sitting by the cosy fire in the evenings became a great way to end each day. The openness of the living area  the large spacious rooms and beautiful wooden floors make this heritage house a very special place. The central location of the neighborhood made it quick and easy to get into town  to the beach and to the airport. The home is very secure  with an electric gate and alarm system and my two year old nephew was able to run around the garden and play without us worrying about him escaping The pool has a secure cover on it  which was excellent too. I can't recommend Sandra and her family's beautiful home enough and we would absolutely stay there again. Thank you  and we hope to see you all again
133339,22157854,2014-10-31,13721862,Ben,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Constantia Villa. The house is delightful and a relaxing place to retun to after a day out. The location is brilliant with easy access to Kloof st and a short distance to Camps Bay and Table Mountain. I particularly appreciated the terrace with views of Table Mountain and large bedroom with a desk and great ensuite bathroom. Alice was an excellent host  friendly and helpful. The neighbourhood is very nice and I felt safe.
133339,23785216,2014-12-10,3210775,Daniel,Tolle Lage nahe der belebten Kloof Street mit Blick auf Tafelberg und Lions Head  gute Austattung des Zimmers mit privatem Bad  sehr nette Gastgeberin die einem bei Fragen zu Restaurants etc sehr gerne weiter hilft.
133339,26776654,2015-02-19,23656128,Christel,Alice war vom ersten Augenblick an eine sehr freundliche  aufmerksame Gastgeberin  die ihr komplettes Haus fr uns ffnete  gute Tips auf unsere Nachfrage gab und trotzdem nie aufdringlich war und unsere Privatsphre respektierte. Es gibt zwei schne  mbilierte Terrassen am Haus  wo wir uns zu jeder Zeit aufhalten konnten  was wir ausgiebig nutzten. Alice erlaubte uns auch auf Nachfrage  Freunde auf ein Glas Wein mitzubringen. Ein tiefes Tauchbecken auf  der hinteren Terrasse sorgt fr Erfrischung  die Terrasse vor dem Haus ist von blhenden Gehlzen umgeben. Die Ausstattung entsprach in jedem Fall der Beschreibung. Die Lage des Hauses ist optimal  man kann zu Fu viele Restaurants  Geschfte  und Sehenswrdigkeiten erreichen. Die Nachbarschaft ist ruhig  der Verkehrslrm hlt sich sehr in Grenzen. Es gibt gute Parkmglichkeiten in der Strae. Wir haben uns 3 Wochen lang sehr wohl und rundrum zuhause gefhlt. Danke Alice  fr dein Vertrauen und danke fr die guten Gesprche.
133339,27972187,2015-03-15,22922003,Sophia,Alice was an attentive and kind host. The bedroom was beautiful and the bed comfortable and big. Location couldn't be better. Lots of great cafes and restaurants a hop and a skip away. Thank you for having us Alice  we'll be back
133339,28301290,2015-03-22,13197207,Egon Nyrup,Vi boede seks dage i Alice's hus og var meget tilfredse. Vrelset var rummeligt  rent og velfungerende bortset fra en irriterende dr mellem sovevrelset og badevrelset. Alice var hjlpsom nr vi havde brug for det. Huset ligger godt placeret i et roligt villakvarter helt tt p restauranter blandt andet flere gode morgenmadsrestauranter og den spndende Kloofstreet. Skal man uden for centrum er det let at tage bussen bde til Waterfront  Queens Beach  Taffelbjerget og Camps Bay. Et glimrende sted at bo.
133339,34890772,2015-06-13,24660687,Cindy,Highly recommend The Constantia Villa is the perfect place to stay while in Cape Town. My husband and I were quite pleased and thankful to share the house with someone as wonderful as the host  Alice. The location could not be better as you have all major roads within 10 minutes and all major Cape Town attractions within 20 minutes from the house as well. The bedroom is extremely comfortable and clean. You have everything you need and more. Alice is great and makes you feel right at home. We could not have asked for a better experience We look forward to our return in the future.

133339,55589662,2015-12-02,1357866,Ulrich,Alice is the perfect host to the perfect Airbnb location in Cape Town. Alice is very welcoming  attentive  and knows the city like the back of her hand. Our room and the entire house were exactly as described. It is within walking distance to great shops and restaurants  and a short drive from the beach. We enjoyed every moment of our stay and would definitely choose Alice's place again
133339,58118174,2016-01-01,37294548,Juliane,Alice was very friendly and welcoming. She answered all our questions and we could make ourselves comfortable in her stunning renovated cottage. The entire cottage and front and back pouch and garden are tastefully renovated and designed. It is very cosy to stay in Victoria Cottage The ceiling fan was so needed as the temperature were blazing when we stayed with Alice - in the mid 30s every day She allowed us to smoke on the front terrace where we could sit on a nice rattan sofa. All in all a very comfortable and relaxed stay
133339,61182462,2016-02-01,27304408,Kasper,We hebben genoten van de eerste 5 nachtjes hier. De locatie is super centraal en op loopafstand zoveel barretjes  restaurants etc.je kan de auto voor de deur parkeren en je bent overal zo. Echt een super locatie om kaapstad te ontdekken Aanrader
133339,62198622,2016-02-12,6393393,Brianna,My husband and I enjoyed a great stay with Alice. The room was exactly as it appears -- clean and comfortable and extremely close to excellent coffee shops  restaurants and main roads through town. We got around using Uber and only ever waited a maximum of 5 minutes for a pickup  usually 2 or 3. Alice was very kind and hospitable  accommodating our late arrival and other small issues with flexibility and care. This is a great home base for a trip to Cape Town.
133339,63026896,2016-02-19,35184995,Johan,Ett hrligt rum i ett vackert hus. Ligger i ett lugnt och mycket charmigt omrde i Kapstaden hgt upp p sluttningen mot Table Mountain och Lions Head. Toppenbra restauranger och frukostkafr alldeles runt hrnet. Det r en fin promenad lngs Koof street upp frn city. Jag trivdes jttebra i rummet och i omrdet och kan varmt rekommendera det. Lugnt och tyst p natten.
22994,59354415,2016-01-10,34388110,Danny,Es waren fantastische Tage  die wir als 5-kpfige Familie in dem geschmackvollen historischen Haus verbracht haben. Uns fehlte es an nichts. Es war alles vorhanden - sogar ein groer Auenpool. Die Haustiere -insbesondere natrlich die Katze und die Hunde - waren sehr direkt sehr vertraut mit uns und haben uns direkt herzlich aufgenommen.  Zudem waren sie vllig problemlos zu handeln - selbst fr uns  die wir gar keine Haustiere haben. Durch die Arlarmanlage und die Hunde haben wir uns stets sehr sicher gefhlt. Das Haus ist gnstig gelegen in einer schnem schnen Viertel. Man kann alles schnell erreichen und sieht auch noch den Tafelberg.
22994,226162969,2018-01-09,103980451,James,The house is very well located in Rondebosch with quick access to all main roads  the town  attractions etc. Food shopping is round the corner. The home and garden are delightful with large well laid out rooms and big living space that opens out onto the raised patio  lawn and swimming pool. We looked after the dogs and hens which was great fun. Dogs are very affectionate but don't pester you in any way. They are happy outside where they spend their time. The house has everything you could need. There is a dishwasher  double oven  5 ring hob  all the cooking equipment you could want etc. There is a BBQ  outside table and chairs  patio furniture. Photos don't do it justice. It is a great place to stay. Communication with the host is excellent  quick and responsive. We had a wonderful stay and would dearly love to stay again
22994,227216466,2018-01-14,10418994,David,A beautiful home with real charm.  The pets  saltwater swimming pool  views of table mountain  and room to really breath all contributed to a tremendous stay in Robdebosch.
22994,722934889,2021-01-09,4567378,Chiara,A great  spacious home with all amenities and sweet pets to look after.  Sandra was very accommodating with all my requests. Well located  although in a very much suburban area of Cape Town. Supermarkets and other basic shops are close by and the city centre is 20 minutes away. Very much recommended for singles and couples.
22994,536745680809007268,2022-01-10,21911388,Anthony,It was a joy staying at Sandras beautiful home  spacious and light with a wrap-around garden even with a pool and a partial view of Table Mountain. Sandra is so thoughtful and communicative at every turn. Its a great location if you have a car. It was a special delight looking after the dog  cats and chickens  very little trouble  though it is a responsibility so its important you feel you can take that on seriously. For us it was wonderful to bond in particular with the dog Sophie  and to enjoy taking her for walks on Rondebosch common nearby a revelation. When the family returned to the house the morning we checked out  it was then so clear why the energy of this house feels so special  as they are a beautiful and charming family indeed. A memorable beginning to our time in Cape Town - warmly recommended.
36347,28130636,2015-03-18,20072667,Nora,We had a wonderful time in Alan's flat. The appartment is very well  decorated and fully furnished as well. The flat looks even nicer than in the pictures  as you have a lovely view on the mountain from the little terrace. The location is also very central. Alan has been a perfect host  very helpful and available. He even arranged a  breakfast for us. Un appartement de style au coeur du Cap que nous recommandons vivement 
36347,28670636,2015-03-28,5550086,Jose,Great location  great space. We had the best time  thank you Alan
36347,28993240,2015-04-02,15860007,Ronan,We had a great time staying in the loft - the place is really interesting and well designed. The loft is in a great part of town and is surrounded by nice restaurants and cafs. Alan was a very kind host and was on hand for advice on anything we needed. The bubbly it was our honeymoon and Easter eggs was a nice surprise.
36347,29282064,2015-04-06,27589955,Andrea,2nd stay at Alan's accommodation was as good as the first one - thank you -
36347,29920113,2015-04-14,2993609,Jillian,Alan was a fantastic host  going above and beyond to leave us breakfast materials  and checking in with us throughout our stay. The place is gorgeous - a little scary if you don't like heights  but wonderful if you do. The balcony view is impressive and the perfect thing to wake up to and arrive home to at night. We would absolutely stay here again.
36347,32121696,2015-05-14,29756797,Jolene,Alan's place was probably the most well-equipped place I have stayed via an AirBnb. He accommodated my requests upon short notice and took the time to provide me with a map and left behind a handy guide with various attractions and sight-seeing suggestions to try around Cape Town.  There's a great market right next door where you can explore and try different local cuisines. I also like to cook for myself  so I went to the supermarket that was nearby and cooked dinner for a friend and myself.  If you want to venture out and try restaurants on the famous Kloof St  the flat is centrally located and grabbing Ubers around town was really inexpensive in comparison to other cities I've visited.
36347,32434516,2015-05-17,10040687,Megan,Alan is an incredible host  and his place is pure magic. You are city center with incredible Moroccan style food court downstairs but the apartment is so quiet and charming . We fell in love with the space. Alan was an informative host that helped us carry our trillion bags up the stairs and made us feel at home. I would highly recommend this spot. Feels like home for sure.
36347,32605017,2015-05-19,7343920,Patrick,Had a great couple of night's in Alan's loft. Great location  amazing space with an awesome view. Alan himself was a great host and went out of his way to make sure we had a comfortable stay.
36347,34282813,2015-06-07,12919730,Zenat,It was great and very quaint.
36347,34644558,2015-06-10,32743436,Laura,This apartment is amazing It's perfectly located in Cape Town  with a good walk to the Waterfront  and lots of restaurants and museums within 5 minutes. AND - it was a beautiful view of Table Mountain. Alan was an incredible host  with a great map to help us get situated  and the internet worked like a charm  so we were able to make lots of plans and enjoy the city. Would absolutely recommend this place
36347,35813022,2015-06-22,1966089,Nancy,Beautiful space and great location. Easy access to great food  coffee  Table Mountain and the waterfront.
36347,36541769,2015-06-29,33193300,Beth,My friend and I very much enjoyed our stay in Alan's adorable little loft. He was an incredibly prepared host  and made us feel incredibly welcome in a new  slightly overwhelming city. Alan offered us cultural suggestions as well as restaurant selections and detailed instructions of how to navigate Cape Town. The loft was impeccably clean  and very nicely situated for navigating the city. It was a unique living experience We would absolutely stay with Alan again
36347,36874568,2015-07-02,8518329,Dana,I loved staying at Alan's place. It's adorable  perfectly located and easy to find. The WiFi is excellent  it was easy to call an Uber and catch rides everywhere I needed to go. And what a sunrisesunset with the beautiful view of Table Mountain.
36347,37264792,2015-07-05,20355237,Josephine,Alan was a fantastic host  he made us feel so welcome and was really helpful in explaining everything in the loft and giving tips on where to go in the area.  The location is ideal for exploring Cape Town  you can walk to lots of restaurants and bars and it's near to a grocery store so that you can stock up when you arrive.  My partner and I stayed here for two nights and Alan was great at accommodating us at very short notice.  The flat itself is lovely  so well designed and stocked with all the necessary things.  Alan even kindly left us some wine and chocolates to welcome us.  I loved the bedroom being on the mezzanine level but those with a fear of heights might want to make sure they feel comfortable before booking.  Highly recommend both Alan and the flat.
36347,37555675,2015-07-08,3017399,Anna,great place homely  great view  really central.  Alan was very welcoming and really helpful.

There was even breakfast food in the fridge. Alan provided us with a great lists of spots to try. The big bonus was that Alan had a parking space close by in a secure location.  We would definitely come back

36347,40080020,2015-07-28,18070688,Rachel,Alan's loft is absolutely fantastic  From prior to the trip when he stayed in constant contact when I had questions and provided detailed information about the area and recommendations for daylocal outings to arranging for the basics to be in the fridge  all T's were crossed and I's were dotted.  The loft itself has amazing dcor  a comfy bed and comforter we slept like babies and a lovely deck with direct view of Table Mtn which we would have loved but for the wind that week.  I would highly recommend this space to another couple or small group as there is a second smaller mattress up top as well.  The building is very secure and the available parking is just around the corner and also very secure.  Enjoy and thank you Alan
36347,44636291,2015-08-28,3119829,Sharon,My friend and I stayed in Alan's apartment for one week during our first visit to South Africa. Our experience was excellent. The loft was exactly as described. We appreciated the secure building  central location  food market downstairs  nearby grocery store  and the apartment decor. We were out and about all day  everyday but always looked forward to returning to the apartment in the evening. We made great use of both the bed and smaller futon  the kitchen  washing machine  and also Alan's nearby parking spot for our rental car. Alan greeted us with wine and other food staples when we arrived tea  milk  juice  bread  bananas  etc.  provided helpful suggestions about where to walk and local markets the Neighborgoods market was our favorite  and was readily available for questions during our stay. I will recommend Alan's apartment to any and all friends visiting Cape Town

36347,50426764,2015-10-12,10635255,Bonnie,Amazing little apartment in the middle of town This apartment was one of those places where it was even better than the photos on air bb described. We stayed for 6 days and alan even sent a cleaner around to freshen the place up for us  very unexpected but very welcomed We loved eating at the Eastern bazaar right next door to the buliding and got around by my citi bus which there is a main bus terminal 3 mins walk down the road. We were very happy customers and would certainly return if in Cape town and also recommend  thanks for having us Alan
36347,51631361,2015-10-22,721522,Ben And Amanda,Alan was an incredible host and his apartment was perfect. It was a home away from home where we could relax after a busy day sightseeing. He provided many recommendations on restaurants  cafe's and activities. His check-in was incredibly smooth and was always on call if we needed anything. Highly recommend staying at this place
36347,52045302,2015-10-26,2735636,Amber,I stayed with two friends at Alans loft and we absolutely loved the place The interior is amazing and there is everything you need coffee  tea  oil  granola etc in a very high quality.

The kitchen has huge doors onto a balcony that has a amazing view of table mountain. In fact the flat is so nice and the view is so good that the first night we arrived  rather than going out for drinks  we just had friends over to ours his instead. Alan was also very accommodating and let us check out 4 hours later than scheduled. I definitely recommend a stay here

133339,63733568,2016-02-26,6986388,Meg,Alice's place was perfect We booked last minute for a one week stay in Cape Town  and we knew we wanted a place in Gardens  walking distance to all of the restaurants and shops. Alice home is in the ideal location  central in Cape Town  with a safe  relaxing  and tranquil vibe. Normally I book entire spaces  and had never done a private room before  so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Alice was welcoming and it was nice to have her around to ask for suggestions on where to go and what to do. We were able to come and go as we pleased  and the suite is located right off of the entryway hall  before the main foyer door to the rest of the home  which made us feel like we had our own private entrance since we didn't have to walk through her entire home to get to our room. I'd recommend Alice's over any hotel room  and would definitely stay again
133339,68129591,2016-04-02,43512332,Valery,Alice is very accommodating and friendly  and always is ready to help you. The house and the room is very cozy and clean. The location is perfect  you can walk everywhere from there. It was a pleasure to stay there. Highly recommended.
133339,72492655,2016-05-02,50541442,Maria,Alice was extremely welcoming Her house was clean  comfortable and classy. Just the perfect place for us. She provided us with a lists of restaurants that were fantastic. Every place we went to was delicious  centrally located. Her directions were easy to understand  very useful. She knows what I want. Alice made us feel at home  she treated us like her family. She would always give us her home made energy bar every morning. Appreciate it very much.  This was our first experience using air BnB and Alice helped make a great first impression. Would highly recommend to friends  would stay with her when I come back. Again Alice thank you so much Hope to see you soon in our country. Btw thank you for the recipe. You are a GREAT host. Value for money. Maria  Edgar
133339,123374462,2016-12-28,92448002,Brigitta,Wir haben uns sehr sicher gefhlt. Restaurants waren fulufig und es war mit etwas Kondition kein Problem in die Stadt zu laufen und wieder zurck  allerdings leicht bergauf. Gegenber der Unterkunft war ein 711 shop  was wir gut genutzt haben. Absolut empfehlenswert.

133339,131014992,2017-02-10,113171199,Carla,I was booked in at Constantia Villa for a few days this month. Unfortunately due to bad weather  my flight to Cape Town was cancelled and in the end  I never made it there. I must say  however  that Alice was wonderful answering all my questions when preparing for my trip and was extremely kind when I told her that I would be cancelling my stay with her. She was very flexible and even gave me a part refund which was very kind of her. I will definitely be in touch with Alice for my next trip to CT
133339,132760690,2017-02-19,1101056,Carina,We stayed at Alice's for one week and enjoyed our time very much. The room is very clean and cosy  the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is very modern and clean too. Definitely hotel standard The location is just PERFECT  so close to Kloof Street and the cool Tamberskloof area. We could walk to most restaurants etc very central but still quiet to sleep at night. We also always found a spot to park our car just in front of the door. We felt very safe during our stay. Alice was very nice and helpful  gave us great recommendations Thanks very much  we will be back -

Beautifully appointed apartment  even stocked with a fridge full of goodies for us when we arrived In a great position central to many of the CBD's attractions  particularly in walking distance to Long St and Bree St for lots of great eateries and bars. Alan was readily available for any help we needed or just for advice on what to do during our stay. Truly a great host and a lovely property
36347,59037539,2016-01-06,4518583,Tim,Can't recommend Alan and his loft highly enough Alan himself was very attentive  generous and understanding  especially given that our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive in CT till very late. Once you arrive and feel the cool vibe of the apartment  notice the attention to detail  enjoy the view of Table Mountain from the floor to ceiling windows  and realize what a great location it is - you'll realize it's all Alan described it as and more Thanks  Alan  we had a great time staying at your place and would happily stay there again when we come back next.
36347,60114696,2016-01-19,7714433,Ming,Check-in was easy  Alan personally waited for us at the apartment to hand us the keys and to give us a quick rundown of the place. The apartment was clean and tidy  as described  well decorated  with a modern industrial theme. Loved the bathroom too  with great shower pressure and a glass tile wall bringing in warmth of the sun but providing privacy. He even provided water  wine  yogurt  and fruits Check-out was even more a cinch with us just locking the door behind us. The location  being right in downtown  was super convenient  easily able to navigate the city with the excellent mycity bus system. However  you do have to be careful as it does get quiet at night with an interesting cast of street loiterers. Alan has been a great host  quick to respond
36347,60752684,2016-01-27,45858749,Alison,My boyfriend and I had a great experience in Cape Town Alan is a wonderful host and thinks of everything you could need - helpful tips for the city sights and restaurants  awesome location right in the city centre.

36347,63610094,2016-02-25,11483773,Maddy,This was an incredible little hideaway in the middle of Cape Town. After staying in Camps Bay for a week it was the perfect change.

We stayed there for 4 nights and it's right in the heart of Cape Town's City Centre  a short walk to shops  restaurants and historical places.  The loft itself is very secure and has a great view of Table Mountain. Very urban chic  it is exposed brick  wood furnishing to touches that make it very cozy. A great place to stay while in Cape Town.
36347,89063940,2016-07-26,253134,Ayden,A perfect stay in a gorgeous loft-- I cannot emphasize how much we loved the loft and its view of Table Mountain. Everything was a breeze  from booking to checking out. As much as we loved Cape Town  it was hard to leave the apartment when it was cold and rainy outside  because it was so cozy inside. I would highly recommend staying in Alan's place  and hope to return some day
36347,92729626,2016-08-09,77134871,Alexa,Alan's space was absolutely enchanting. I loved every minute of my stay there. The location is within walking distance of everything you could need or want. The space was clean and homey. My favorite was sitting on the balcony and looking out at table mountain. Longmarket street can look a bit seedy at times  but I never had any issues and felt completely safe inside the building because there's essentially three levels of security in order to get into the apartment. As a host  Alan was easy to reach and checked in periodically to make sure everything was going well. Upon my arrival he stocked my fridge with the essentials and a bottle of wine. When I come back to Cape Town I would absolutely make his place my first choice again.
36347,96509675,2016-08-23,59796534,Robert,I cannot say enough good things about Alan and his loft. Alan provided all of the basic necessities along with tea  coffee  snacks  access to Apple TV  etc. The location is incredible  the loft itself is extremely comfortable  and Alan himself was very easy to get into contact with for any questions or concerns.

The loft has a great style  and we found the loft bed very comfortable. Yeah there's no railing  but we enjoyed it. The shower had better water pressure than we have at home  and it was great being able to use their carport for our rental car. They also left helpful snacks and beverages in the fridge for the stay. We would stay at this place again in a heartbeat.

133339,590653329,2020-01-09,298731311,Ferhat,Die Unterkunft hat eine tolle Lage  sodass alle wichtigen Sehenswrdigkeiten gut zu erreichen sind. Direkt gegenber befindet sich ein Supermarkt. Auerdem sind tolle Restaurants in unmittelbarer Nhe. Die Ausstattung der Unterkunft entspricht der Beschreibung und wurde sehr liebevoll eingerichtet. Vielen Dank Alice fr deine sehr freundliche und vor allem aufmerksame Art. Wir knnen die Unterkunft definitiv weiterempfehlen
133339,601320578,2020-02-03,9447620,Stefanie,Very nice place The room is perfect  clean  and big. Very good location Loved our stay here 
133339,613880892,2020-03-03,36107151,Marije,I felt at home in Alice's place. She was very welcoming. The room was lovely. I also loved staying in the quiet area  but still being close to all the nice restaurants and shops.
133339,594742549764891218,2022-03-31,242725035,Laetitia,Alices house is a well-hidden treasure in the Upper Kloof area. Delightful eateries are just around the corner and a walk down Kloof street brings you right into the city centre. The road leading to Table  Mountain cable car  to Camps Bay and the magnificent road to Houtbay  is within easy reach.
133339,804177270023399592,2023-01-14,755892,Natalie,Great location  a comfy bed  clean room  and there were so many thoughtful details as to what a guest might need during their stay. Alice is kind  helpful  and accommodating. We loved walking over to Nourish'd in the morning for breakfast and it was easy to park outside her place. Of course renting a room in someone's home  you have to expect that you won't necessarily use the other areas. We didn't feel comfortable necessarily cooking or using the pool  but I'm sure it would have been fine had we requested it. We used the front outdoor area mostly and it felt like we had it to ourselves which was nice. Lots of great restaurants close by and the view of Table Mountain when you walk out the front door is breathtaking.
133339,807783374245770290,2023-01-19,4764023,Teddy,Alice is a wonderful hostess  always helpful and very friendly. One must note that in Cape Town  as everywhere in South Africa  the power is turned off several times a day load shedding. Alice has taken care of this and provides not only lamps  but also an operation of the Wifi with its own power supply. Just great if you have to do some work on the side or simply can not do without the Internet. Above that  the room and the small garden is very nice and you feel like you are staying with friends. A recommendation.
133339,819416052848352410,2023-02-04,7872233,Laura,We loved to stay at Alices place. It is a beautifull house and very cosy. The garden is amazing and a nice place for spending a summer night. Alice is super friendly and helpfull. Even booked our second stay in Capetown here

Alice ist eine sehr freundliche  hilfbereite Person Die Umgebung an der Kloof Street ist perfekt fr einen Aufenthalt geeignet.

Thank you  Alan
36347,126338801,2017-01-10,10714097,Lisa,Alan's apartment is the perfect spot to get a real feel of living in Cape Town. Centrally located  perfect for any length of stay  you are walking distance from tons of fabulous restaurants and bars and only a short  inexpensive Uber ride to the beaches. Alan is super quick to communicate and was happy to help with anything we needed. The apartment itself is very clean and organized.  It's very charming with a lovely view of Table Mountain. There is lots of room to unpack if you decide to stay awhile too. We loved our stay here and would definitely choose to stay here again Thanks Alan for everything
36347,127119832,2017-01-16,12432020,Andrew,Alan's loft if awesome Great location to explore the city and experience life like a Capetonian.

36347,134774112,2017-02-28,78317661,Dirk,Sofortige Kontaktaufnahme per Telefon  also sehr persnlich. Auch vor Ort jederzeit erreichbar. Die persnliche Einweisung in das Objekt war vorbildlich. Loft sehr gut ausgestattet. Hier fehlt es an nix  selbst ein Trockner ist vorhanden. Bckerei  Supermarkt  Restaurants  Bars einen Steinwurf entfernt. Viele POI sind fusslufig erreichbar. Trotz zentraler Lage relativ ruhig gelegen. Sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Bei Ankunft wurde uns eine kalte Flasche Wein offeriert. Abreise und Zeitvereinbarung unkompliziert. Wir knnen diese Unterkunft uneingeschrnkt wrmstens empfehlen.
36347,134959037,2017-03-02,6757755,Maxine,We loved everything about Alan's place - it's super cool The flat itself is really well put together and very stylish. The balcony has an amazing view  so nice to have some outside space too. The pool is super swanky and much appreciated  not to mention the car parking space. Which is so useful in that busy part of town. - Both in the building across the road. The location is bang in the centre of Cape Town. Alan and his team were very helpful and accommodating as well. Many thanks  Max and Max

36347,140353100,2017-03-29,23465799,Valerie,Alan's place is a beautiful and well-appointed oasis in the city.  Wonderful and thoughtful touches  such as local coffee  fruit  and a bottle of wine made us immediately feel at home. Alan and his partners gave spot-on local advice and put together a terrific city guide. A small patio with amazing views and nearby pool access completed the feeling of having a vacation within a vacation. Hope to stay with Alan again
36347,145839485,2017-04-20,2735633,Jennifer And Scott,This is a beautiful space with great light and because we were traveling for a couple of weeks  having access to the laundry facilities was helpful.  Alan left local coffee  fresh flowers and snacks which was much appreciated.  Uber works in this area like a charm.  We barely had time to get downstairs if we contacted Uber from the apartment.  The location is within walking distance to many cafes and restaurants. Alan left a great reference book of ideas for guests that we found incredibly useful.  The ladder to the loft is a bit steep and may not be for every age andor disposition.
36347,152158972,2017-05-15,5532627,Rebecca,My week staying here in Cape Town was great. The apartment has a beautiful view  and is in a great location to walk around  catch the sightseeing bus  or catch an uber. Check in and check out were easy and organized.  Definitely recommend

200211,2073978,2012-08-23,1530249,Ali,The apartment is spacious  clean and had has all amenities you may need. Our hosts were also very helpful. The location is a bit far from the city centre but very close to seapoint attractions  and you can anytime find a taxi or take the minibuses from seapoint which is very easy and cheap. I can fully recommend this lovely apartment and wish to visit amazing Cape soon again.
200211,2459680,2012-09-30,800568,Nelia,We loved staying in this apartment. It felt homely and all the comforts that we needed where provided for. It is centrally located and the view is breathtaking. Not a full sea view  however when you sit at the window you can gaze out to see between the buildings. Absolutely lovely. We will definitely be back soon.
200211,2888349,2012-11-15,3934767,Gildwen,It was a real pleasure to stay at Anne-Lotte's flat. Location is great 5min from city center by car and facing waterfront and it is spacious.

36347,156776808,2017-06-01,2578704,Anne,We had a great time exploring Cape Town and staying in this apartment. Alan was very easy to communicate with and the photos of the loft are very accurate. The place is beautiful and we loved the uniqueness of it. Like the description mentions  if you have issues with a loft style bed with no rails  this would not be a good fit for you Calling Ubers was really easy and we used Ubers frequently  esp after it got dark.
36347,158750318,2017-06-08,132846990,Vivian,Jederzeit wieder

Alan and Mari made us feel very welcome I've loved waking up every morning being able to see Table Mountain and strolling through the Company Gardens for breakfast. We'd recommend Alan's place - will be coming back for our next visit
36347,165518773,2017-07-01,97873916,Juan,The place and ambience is great - for light sleepers not the best as there is an extraction fan in the balcony. Food smells might come along.
36347,167354369,2017-07-06,1296176,James,Lovely apartment. Modern  funky  spotlessly clean. Very much enjoyed my time here. Found the position of the bed on the platform slightly unnerving as one wrong move out of bed could have been disastrous
36347,169012335,2017-07-11,31154263,Iseult,Alan was very helpful when I arrived at his place. He gave me a lot of tips for my running and hiking desire. So great to be in his place where everything is so close by  when I will come back in Cape Town I don't hesitate to stay here again. Thanks very much for everything.
36347,172992757,2017-07-22,136710967,Kelly,Cool place  clean  comfy with all the creature comforts. Excellent hosts who went above and beyond in service. Would recommend for couples looking to explore Cape Town as its an excellent location with landmarks and eateries all within walking distance.

Amazing view of Table Mountain Devil's Peak from the terrace and roof. Felt totally at home in the space. Would definitely recommend and hope to return ourselves.
36347,181710319,2017-08-13,6934092,Emily,This was a wonderful base  for our trip to Cape Town. Very thoughtfully designed apartment with lots of funky details. Great location. Mezzanine beds felt a bit precarious without a railing but we soon got used to them Loved the view from the balcony.

200211,4651049,2013-05-18,6052505,Christopher,Apartment's very nice and so was Anne-Lotte's friend Stewart.  Location was great  very safe and convenient.  The only downside is the internet its actually a 3g router so there's limited data not dsl.
200211,5321111,2013-06-24,449414,Ozgur,Stayed in Anne-Lotte's apartment for 8 days. It was another perfect airbnb experience. Her house is great  we had everything we needed. From cooking to washing. She was very nice to leave us wine and chocolate for our welcome. Anne-Lotte was out of town then  but Steward was there to greet us and he was great. He gave us good tips about the neighborhood and some restaurants. I will not look for another place to stay if i can go back to Capetown for another visit again.
36347,199922237,2017-10-03,94960357,Astrid,Das Apartment ist einfach perfekt Genau wie auf den Bildern  sehr stylisch  super ausgestattet und mit Wohlfhlatmosphre. Besonders hat uns auch gefallen  dass notwendige Grundlebensmittel sogar frische vorhanden waren  man also nach Ankunft nicht direkt einkaufen musste. Die Lage ist direkt im Zentrum Kapstadts und der dazugehrige Parkplatz ist goldwert. Alan war immer und zu jeder Zeit fr uns erreichbar und stand mit Rat und Tat zur Seite. Nicht zuletzt ist die Sauberkeit des Lofts zu erwhnen Wir waren zwei Wochen da und erhielten zur Halbzeit neue Wsche und eine Vollreinigung. Danke Alan  wir kommen jederzeit gerne wieder
36347,202357095,2017-10-11,386265,Tracey,We stayed in Alans apartment for 5 nights. It was hard to leave. It has a really clever interior  a dramatic view of Table Mountain and the location is amazing for people who like to be in the centre of things. Many of Cape Towns tourist attractions  interesting restaurants  bars and the beautiful Company Gardens are a quick walk from the Loft. Alan provided great advice on the area. Dont  hesitate to stay here.
36347,203182595,2017-10-14,45411136,Christie,Super nice
36347,204440177,2017-10-18,101684947,Aimee,The loft is amazing Love the style and coziness. Very central location down town. Walking distance from most things. Very easy to get uber for adventures a little farther away. Felt safe with how secure the building was. Alan was very helpful and attentive to all our questions about Cape Town Would highly recommend the loft to anyone visiting Cape Town
36347,207351876,2017-10-29,16469870,Maria,Very nice appartment to explore Cape Town or start your trip. Communication with Alan was very quick an uncomplicated. Ill definitely recommend that place and come back.
36347,210545193,2017-11-10,1831369,Michel,Great place and very central. The loft and decoration are beautifully designed and from the balcony you have a great view to Tablemountain. If someone wants to feel the vibe of the city  this is the place to be.
36347,221303773,2017-12-26,160719491,Edith,This apartment was an amazing place to stay in Cape Town and a great airbnb experience
36347,230115826,2018-01-27,37393374,Melissa,Lovely apartment. Great central location. An aerie loft for sleeping. Being nimble and not afraid of heights helps Luxurious bedding  comfortable bed  very cool decor  nicely equipped kitchen  convenient parking and free laundry.
36347,232954794,2018-02-07,94097056,Brooke,Alan is a helpful host and a cool dude. We felt comfortable and connected to this studio space immediately. We loved making breakfasts and dinners in the stylish little kitchen and eating on the balcony and planning our excursions there. The stocked fridge with essentials and a couple delectable treats was a huge boost after an exhausting travel. Trip of a lifetime and really glad we stayed here.
200211,6190998,2013-08-03,6026943,Olivia,We stayed at 21 Ocean view end of July 13. No 21 Ocean view is a very comfortable and nice furnished self catering accommodation. Very good located near shops restaurants  busstation downtown in a safe and quiet neighbourhood. Nice sea wievs and comforts like washing machine  wifi  nespressonmachine lt3 ... where the icing on the cake. Busstop is close to the house  but heres so much to explore in Capetown  I recommend hiring a car Thanks Stewart to take care very good about everything.
200211,6346344,2013-08-09,6965616,Margaret,The apt was lovely I felt right at home and enjoyed my stay in Cape Town. It was my first time with Air BnB and it was a great experience. The mobile wifi was such a great plus. Stewert was very helpful I highly recommend this apt.
200211,7575947,2013-09-25,6953966,Joanne,We had an amazing stay in this lovely and comfortable apartment. We were met by Stewart and his wife who were both so lovely and had left us some wine and strawberries The apartment itself is just as gorgeous as in the photo's It has literally everything you could need or want. Washing machine  clothes dryer  coffee machine  wifi access  ironing board...even a towel heater The apartment is at the end of a small road so the area is very quiet at night. Seapoint is also full of shops and restaurants so you could walk for dinner. We also called a cab to take us to table mountain which only costed us 90rand from the apartment. Overall  amazing place and amazing location and the apartment is managed by very lovely people
200211,8016100,2013-10-13,6043680,Jrgen,Das Apartment liegt ruhig oberhalb der Einkaufsstrae und hat einen tollen Blick. Die Zimmer sind ausreichend gro und wir haben alles gefunden was wir bentigten. Mit dem Auto waren wir sehr schnell an der Waterfront. Der Empfang durch Stewart war sehr nett und er hatte schon Wein und einige Kleinigkeiten zum Essen besorgt.
200211,8403385,2013-10-29,8015075,Jaime,We had a wonderful stay at 21 Miramar Great location  nice view  and welcoming host. It was perfect for our week stay in Cape Town. Everything we needed was in the apartment kitchen supplies  linens  etc.  and the host made check-in and check-out easy  even though we ended up having some travel delays.
200211,8854377,2013-11-22,2309628,Arno,I've been meaning to post a note about our stay at 21 Miramar apartments since we returned from our fabulous Cape Town holiday  but got swept away with work straight away. Anne-Lotte's apartment was absolutely perfect for our needs. The apartment is situated incredibly centrally and although we had our own car  we did make use of public transport which is less than 5 minutes walk from the apartment  up or down a somewhat steep hill  but that was not a challenge or hinderance for us. The apartment is well set up as a holiday rental and very quite. We stayed for almost a week and had no issues at all. It is also very  very secure and the views are incredible. It feels very secluded and that made it feel somewhat special. Communication with Anne-Lotte was always within hours and Stuart was very efficient at checking us in and out. We will definitely consider staying here again  in fact it would feel like coming home.
200211,9225201,2013-12-15,9199261,Michael,We had an absolutely fantastic stay everything was in the apartment you could need and superb location in Sea Point... Would definitely stay again
200211,9437394,2013-12-29,6081916,Jon And Jeanette,A delightful apartment  well equipped and located.  Excellent attention to detail by Stuart  who was flexible with checkinout.  Beautiful views and an easy walk to a plethora of excellent restaurants  shops  groceries  etc.  Not such an easy walk back  but that climb just helps burn a few of the calories after excellent food and fine SA wines on Main Street.  A thoughtful welcome basket helped us settle in.  Close on-street parking always available  if a bit snug.  Maybe best not to bring the oversized pickup  Now we're looking for our own DriBuddy Thanks  Anne-Lotte and Stuart.
36347,235541049,2018-02-17,1769870,Flip,Very nice pad in the center of Cape Town Very open kind of no doors place. It was two of us staying as a couple - if you are more than two than you need to know eachother very well  It is well equipped with coffee  tea  granola etc. Just bring some milk  fruit and baked goods to enjoy the terrace with table mountain view for breakfast. It is in a lively corner with great eats and drinks in walking distance
36347,238838687,2018-02-27,25790462,Lara,I cant rate this spot high enough. The space itself is spotless  and beautifully designed. Communication with Alan and Grant couldnt have been easier. The thoughtful touches like snacks in the fridge  delicious teas and lots of adaptors made it. Bonus is that its located abouve Eastern Food bazaar but not noisy so you can pop downstairs for an amazing curry
36347,239324261,2018-03-01,174613437,Dean,Cozy and beautifully furnished flat in the city centre. Great minimalistic style with everything you need. There is no door for the bathroom 
36347,244101342,2018-03-18,2828693,Zoe,As a small family we settled in here immediately. This place has charm Would recommend it to everyone.
36347,247997197,2018-03-30,35128091,Ryan,This place is amazing Perfect for a single traveler or a couple Super central on Cape Town  enjoy
36347,249423171,2018-04-02,34257774,Yang,Amazing loft with a nice terrace facing Table Mountain and Devils Peak. Grant brought us fresh fruit and breakfast. Very nice experience overall
36347,251204183,2018-04-07,172965114,Tian,If it's available  take it. You won't regret.
36347,255284143,2018-04-20,37903120,Puck,Alan was a great host and responded really quickly
36347,266511152,2018-05-20,54224246,Anja,Beautiful flat  friendly and helpful check-in.
36347,272109102,2018-06-03,191995153,David,Mega schickes Apartment. Sehr gute Lage mitten in der Stadt. Der Fernseher mit Netflix hat uns den ein oder anderen Abend verst. Hatten eine sehr schne Zeit und haben uns sehr wohl gefhlt.
36347,274953258,2018-06-10,67237878,George,For those of you looking for a perfect location  stylish  cosy interior and a spotlessly clean Cape Town apartment  look no further than Alan's place. A perfect environment to relax after a day exploring and if there any issues Alan and team are always on hand. Stayed here for four nights and would stay for four more In a heartbeat.
36347,288196881,2018-07-09,7384120,Shekinah,Alans flat is my favorite Airbnb in the world. This was my second stay. I would come back many more times. Its just perfect in every way. Book if you can
200211,10337163,2014-02-14,11612762,Maggy,Loved our stay  Very convenient and beautiful location in a quiet and safe neighbourhood.The appartment is comfortable and full of light.
200211,10980496,2014-03-16,4536143,Gary,This is a great apartment in a great location. It was spotless and had everything we needed. Had good wi-fi  essential these days. The welcome pack was exceedingly generous and we needn't have done an initial shop Anne-Lotte was not in the country and had delegated the initial welcome he was helpful and checked on us a couple of times during the fortnight. I can wholeheartedly recommend the apartment.
200211,11181753,2014-03-24,12057714,John,My friend and I rented Anne-Lotte's place for a week in South Africa based in Cape Town. It's honestly hard to overstate how happy we were that we chose it. The apartment is beautiful and was perfect for two but would just as easily accommodate three. The third in our party had to drop out at the last minute. Lots of light and windows  smart fixtures and finishes  and comfortable space. The location's perfect as a home base for exploring Cape Town and surrounding locales. Buzz-worthy restaurants and bars all within short walking distance  and the MyCiTi bus andor car rental make the rest of the city e.g.  Clifton beach  VA waterfront  Long Street readily accessible.
200211,11528804,2014-04-07,10007496,Maryline,Super clean  and cosy apartment with everything needed for ultimate comfort. Welcomed to a bottle of local wine  cold beers  milk  cookies and fresh fruit to which was a plus An amazing view  great location away from bustle but close to fantastic restaurants and the seafront. Loved it Thank you to Yuri and Rowen for everything too 
200211,11741288,2014-04-14,12060936,David,Myself  my son and daughter spent 5 nights here  and had a fabulous time. The apartment had everything we needed and wanted  it was beautifully furnished  spotlessly clean and the fab welcome pack was much appreciated. Great location to explore CT and beyond  we could live in this place  no problematic all.
200211,12448862,2014-05-03,7082999,Jeanette,The organization was great. Rouwen was waiting for us although we were a little late. We really enjoyed the welcome package bread  coffee  cookies and apples. The apartment corresponded 100 to the description and met all our expectations inclusive the security measures. The view to the sea is marvelous. Many thanks again for the late check out.
200211,15348271,2014-07-07,871935,Neha,Fantastic flat in a lovely location Very clean and comfortable with gorgeous views  and it's within walking distance to the ocean  restaurants  etc. I'd definitely recommend this place  and hope to stay there again the next time I'm in Cape Town.
200211,16212619,2014-07-23,6837760,Sarah,Anne-Lotte's apartment was extremely comfortable and a lovely place to stay for our week in Cape Town. The place was exactly as described with some lovely additions - ipod dock  coffee machine and of course the bread  wine and cake which was left for us. The location was in a good  quiet residential area  with the beach and shops etc nearby. Street parking was absolutely fine and we had no worries in terms of safety at all. Communication with Anne-Lotte herself  Rowen and Martyn was all very easy and efficient and we were made to feel very welcome. We would certainly not hesitate to stay here if we find ourselves in Cape Town again - thank you for a lovely stay 
200211,19548504,2014-09-14,16649423,Bianca,Very warm welcome and attentive care from Anne-Lotte's repersentative here in CT. Rowen was always super helpful. It's a lovely apartment for travellers who want a quiet  attractive respite from the city. Great location  close to many restaurants. My only criticism is the state of the matrasses. Would have appreciated new  firm beds. Thanks for accommodating us  despite hassles re dog. Much appreciated.
200211,20050474,2014-09-22,21115623,Antigone,We loved our stay in Anne-Lotte's Quant apartment in Sea Point. She was very kind as to leave us a welcome bottle of wine and some fruit. It was central  just two roads from the main strip. The apartment was in a quiet corner of the street which made it pleasant. There was always parking available and walking stairs down to high level bus stop if you wished to walk  anywhere  or needing to catch public transport. The host was in contact with us over the week and quick to attend to any of our needs. A very lovely stay indeed. Thank you
200211,21502528,2014-10-19,12362440,Peter,A comfortable appartment in a perfect location Well equipped  beautiful view and an easy walk down to the sea. We also allways found a place to park our car near the appartment. Thank you to Rowen for the excellent service. He was very kind and helpful. We really loved it to stay 5 nights in this great place.
200211,22146307,2014-10-31,19206320,Andreas,Perfect...just perfect In our case for a couple and a 13 year old boy travelling by car. Easy to find  easy and quick access to all of Capetowns must-sees  safe  clean  seabreezy...what can I say Next time travelling to Capetown I wouldnt bother to look for a different place if Miramar21 was available
200211,22522411,2014-11-09,6782280,Joyce,We loved staying in Anne-Lotte's apartment. It has everything you need  is very comfortable and it has a great view. Also  it has many nice restaurants nearby at the main road. Walking back from the main road to the apartment is a bit of an exercise though  because of the steep climb. Rowen  who checked us in and out was a really nice guy. After day one the fridge was broken and he did his very best to solve the problem as fast as possible.
36347,313447202,2018-08-25,188859125,Carly,Gorgeous space- feel like you are in an aesthetic rustic apartment yet in the middle of the city. Wonderful host  super easy check in. Thanks Alan
36347,320718967,2018-09-09,65323132,Leith,Super stylish apartment. Clean  with lots of special touches like fresh flowers  fresh bread  fruit and a bottle of wine. A real little haven in the middle of the city. Great vibe and food at Eastern Food Bazaar below the apartment. We really enjoyed our stay.
36347,328811510,2018-09-27,86468861,Thomas,This place is perfect for relaxing once you have for explored Cape Town. The interior touches like the plants and books make you feel immediately at home. The loft style sleeping area is an interesting quirk and makes the place unique. Definitely recommend.
36347,338764871,2018-10-20,33658938,Katerina,Great  stylish apartment in the heart of the City Bowl. Felt like home 
36347,340227365,2018-10-23,9955406,Olivia,Absolutely wonderful place. Super central. Stunning little balcony outside. Kitchen has everything you need. I will definitely come and stay again
36347,343287353,2018-10-31,11501305,Tracy,We adored Alan's loft in Cape Town. The central location of the apartment  meant that it was easy to walk around for fooddrinks but also great for tour pick ups or Uber. The apartment was comfortable and clean. We were there just over a week so we had the option for the apartment to be cleaned. Everything worked well and Alan was easily reached for any issues. The check in was easy and hassle free. Alan had provided us with breakfast options including coffee beans which we ground daily. We also used the laundry. The view of Table Mountain everyday did not get old. The plants gave the apartment a homely feel. The only downside was the day we had to leave.
36347,344821019,2018-11-04,25875099,Sabine,Great stay at Alans place Location is good  very stylish apartment  has everything you need for a nice stay in Cape Town.
36347,345810579,2018-11-06,51446361,Benjamin,Very stylish flat in a great location - would recommend. Only reason I've put 4 stars rather than 5 is that the lights over the dining room were not working  and oven dials a bit loose  and the gas for the cooker had run out when we arrived so could not cook. However  Alan was a great host and fixed the problem quickly
36347,346592926,2018-11-09,217913917,Marian,This is an absolutely beautiful home We felt lucky to stay in such a unique space. We also enjoyed the ease of the self-check-in and the downtown location.
36347,349784073,2018-11-18,54437818,Ruth,An excellent loft apartment in the centre of Cape Town which is a great base for exploring the city.
36347,351500475,2018-11-23,106745096,Bryony,Lovely little spot in Central CT  close to all the gorgeous restaurants of Bre St  Company Gardens and a nice  buzzy neighbourhood. The apartment was beautiful  easy entry but felt secure nonetheless and a lovely space  beautifully designed with lots of personality and thoughtful touches like an annotated map of the local area and restaurant recommendations Thank you  Alan  for a lovely stay.
200211,23360901,2014-11-30,20881333,Ju Li,Great city  great Appartement. Everything you need for staying there for 2 or more weeks... Safe area in cape town and close to waterfront. MyCity busstations are very close too.
200211,24075760,2014-12-19,18788733,Beth,I spent two weeks at Anne's place and loved it Will definitely recommend to anyone staying in Cape Town in the future and will probably be back
200211,25138244,2015-01-07,6054384,Mandy,I loved to stay in Anne-Lotte appartment. It is full of ligh  clean in a very nice and safe area. We were very well welcome by food for first days and a bootle of wine. The host is really taking care about their guests and stay always in contact. It felt like a cosy home and it is very well equiped with all what you need for staying for some days. I will for sure come back. 5 stars service
200211,25262081,2015-01-11,17045206,Larry And Anna,Such a lovely apartment  Annelotte wasn't there unfortunately but her sister in law Adele was an extremely helpful host. There were many comforting touches such as wine milk coffee tea etc. Adele was always on hand to help us out and we would definitely recommend the apartment and would love to stay again
200211,25951110,2015-01-31,17499342,Candace,We were lost and she drove to meet us and lead us to the apt  and even added a tv channel for my husband for the week. We requested a few other items and they were brought right away.
200211,27242580,2015-03-01,4172686,Anthea,Our month at 21 was most comfortable and had everything we needed.  Thank you to you both for accommodating our early arrivals.  The location was perfect for good restaurants  bus stops and taxis.  The steps certainly kept us fit  Thank you again for everything  Anthea and Lesley
200211,27572986,2015-03-08,11071411,Annika,Everything was perfect. The flat and the location are great and the house is in a very safe area of Cape Town. You find everything you could possibly need in the flat and everyone made a big effort for us to make our stay just brilliant.
200211,27880287,2015-03-14,7645317,Dorine,Great place  great location and great city The whole renting and check-incheck-out process was easy going and made us feel very welcome. We'll come back 
200211,28599677,2015-03-27,13843703,George,Great place and terrific host. The view is worth the hike to get there.
200211,28818611,2015-03-30,1106991,Liz,Since Anne was out of the country her sister in law Adele welcomed us. Prior to arriving we had a few questions and Adele and Anne got back to us right away each time. The place was exactly as described  stunning view and great location. Adele and Anne left chocolates  coffee and wine for us. The place was clean and airy. Adele told us to call or text with any questions and was always quick to respond. I would stay here again and recommend it highly to anyone looking for a 2 bedroom spot away from downtown near the beach
200211,29929657,2015-04-14,29354398,Kristin,Sean  the complex caretaker was there to facilitate handing over of the keys on arrival and leaving. He was very helpful and friendly. The pictures are a good reflection of the flat  it's sunny with beautiful views and close enough to walk to the beach.
200211,30474503,2015-04-22,16224130,Babalo,We loved the apartment and the proximity to everything. After initial teething issues  our host Adele was very helpful and kept in touch all the time. The apartment was perfect for us with a family of two girls and their nanny. The only downside was that there is no parking inside the premises but off street parking is very safe and so is the neighborhood. I just think I was too lazy to walk.
36347,363149139,2018-12-28,6705265,Nicole,We had the most amazing 3 weeks in this apartment. The apartment is stunning  one of the best Airbnbs weve ever stayed in  the location in Cape Town is excellent- walking distance to Bre street and a short uber from hikes and beaches. Access to the gym was really nice and Alan was very communicative and helpful. We would highly recommend this apartment to anyone coming through Cape Town.
36347,369312981,2019-01-10,168400437,Ben,A brilliant  stylish city pad  perfect for exploring all that Cape Town has to offer. Would highly recommend staying here and Alan is the perfect Airbnb host.
36347,400162950,2019-01-11,15052647,Charlotte,Would highly recommend Alans loft  it was perfect for our Cape Town stop over - could happily have stayed longer. It was a great find. Thank you
36347,406344991,2019-01-29,163000597,Rashan,Alan's place was very stylish and centrally located. I must say that the building is a bit old compared to some others in the area. The area is very active and busy  but when you're inside you literally can't hear anything from outside. Overall  my partner and I enjoyed our stay and Alan was on top of things and handled all of our issues promptly. I'd deff stay here again
36347,406892176,2019-01-31,151293286,William,really nice place  feels like someones well designed home rather than the usual bland airbnb apartment.  watching the clouds come over the mountain from a comfortable couch is a true luxury
36347,408329110,2019-02-04,85601241,Lara,Stylish and cool space and easy and straightforward instructions to get in
36347,411648965,2019-02-13,86363382,Nicole,Alans place is even better than the pictures. He was such a communicative host and was kind enough to meet me at the place. The Airbnb is fully stocked with everything you need  and there are many tips in the book that is provided. I had such a good time and I hope to be back soon.
36347,414922723,2019-02-21,26791660,Marc,Charming appartment  excellent location to enjoy the nightlife
36347,418479500,2019-03-02,39159126,Alex,Awesome location  cozy loft in the heart of Cape Towns city center. Almost all the best restaurants and coffee shops are within walking distance. We set up shop here for four days and it was a great home base for exploring everything that Cape Town has to offer. Alan was an amazing host  responsive and helpful whenever we needed it. We could not have asked for a better stay.
36347,420303778,2019-03-06,7177483,Dani,Really cool spot in the middle of downtown. Beautiful view of table mountain from the outside table and chairs Would definitely recommend Alans place.
36347,420638856,2019-03-07,7938376,Rosalyn,Alan's place was great. The loft is very cool  modern  and unique. We only stayed at Alan's place for one night  but he was communicative about our stay and allowed us to use his dedicated parking bay the day of check out so that we could leave our rental car and continue to explore Cape Town on our last day in the city  which was extremely helpful. Alan also brought over eggs and a bottle of rose in person  which was a lovely additional detail to a fun stay in the loft
36347,422825566,2019-03-12,17399906,Marion,We had a great stay at Alans. The apartment is very cosy and communication with Alan was great While the neighborhood is centrally located we did not feel incredibly comfortable at night.
36347,425432858,2019-03-18,45324981,Caitlin,Stylish  well-equipped funky loft space in the perfect location for accessing all parts of the City. Awaken in the shadow of Devil's Peak and close your eyes to the swirling smells of Eastern Market curries. You're a skip  a jump from Company's Gardens  Longmarket  Bree Streets  and MyCiti Bus  which will carry you anywhere. Great value for the location and accommodation  and Alan is a gem of a host.
36347,427281714,2019-03-23,33884576,Susie,Nice apartment Be mindful that your bed is in a loft Location of apartment is great for walking to most sights in CT  definitely recommend catching Uber super cheap everywhere at night
200211,63512162,2016-02-23,41412577,Ben,Anne-Lotte made our booking fun and easy. Her place is exactly matching with the pictures shown. There will be everything you might looking for  great place. We had a wonderful time in Seapoint and I absolutely love Anne-Lottes place Also  since now one mentioned that so far  I highly recommend the Lions Head path starting just behind the building... Hikers  have fun 
200211,65957324,2016-03-18,55675902,Kelly,This was a fantastic stay in a fantastic location. Her sister Adele was very helpful in meeting us and even helping us with some troubles we encountered she was willing to help us figure out what to do when one of the scooters we rented stopped working.  The apartment was as lovely as it looks  easy to get around town  and the host was great.
200211,91308661,2016-08-04,4977184,Ferrari,I loved Anne's space. It was exactly as listed. Very clean  secure  with an amazing view. The bed is comfortable as well. I would definitely recommend it.
200211,123008520,2016-12-27,106274997,Jared,Absolutely loved staying at No 21. It's perfectly situated and was more than adequate for my needs. Great value for money and our host was very accommodating.
200211,141114497,2017-04-02,55877881,Trent,We had a wonderful stay  highly recommend And will definitely be back. Everything you need and an amazing host
200211,142698539,2017-04-09,102998492,Louise,Great location  uber from the airport will cost around 18. Quick and easy to get uber to this location  helpful as we did not rent a car. Very close to a lot of attractions and great view from the apartment. Everyone who I was in contact with were a great help. Lovely  clean apartment. Very secure. Ideal for staying in the heart of Cape Town.
200211,144525555,2017-04-16,27786688,Aimee,I stayed at Anne's place for one week and truly enjoyed my time there. The windows looking out onto the ocean views were lovely to wake up to. The flat is nicely furnished and has all of the supplies needed for self catering. Uber is rather affordable and was an easy way to get around parts of the city. Alternatively  the flat is a few blocks down from public transport. The caretaker was responsive and helpful at all times. Definitely value for money.
36347,431539506,2019-04-01,62981683,Robert,My girlfriend and I spent a week at Alan's place and we were pleasantly surprised the minute we walked. The flat was larger than we had expected based on pictures and some other reviews  and very stylish and modern. A fully outfitted kitchen  large dining area  comfortable sofa  wi-fi and a smart TV ensures you have all amenities you need. The bathroom doesn't give full privacy since there is no door to shut out  but this is not really a problem if you are a couple or a small family. The loft style sleeping area worked well  but it will get hot so make sure to put on the air-condition before going to bed. Location is great  and perfect for exploring the city - which is made even easier with a book of recommendation from Alan. The place is not perfect as there were some minor issues  as one will find in all airbnb places  but noting big. All in all it is very hard to beat the value for money in this place. Thanks again Alan
36347,434090947,2019-04-07,166749843,Marieke,Lovely place Alan was very helpful and a nice host.
36347,445926654,2019-04-30,10988670,Maurits,Great quaint place in central location
36347,447359194,2019-05-03,229182028,Jenya And Chris,A stylish and well thought out apartment close to all you want to see in Cape Town with a stunning view to match. We had a wonderful stay  thank you Alan
36347,451804389,2019-05-12,78089896,Zack,Alan's place definitely made my stay in Cape Town.  The loft was super stylish  comfortable  and had all the amenities we could as for.   The location is great.  Alan's place is a close walk  to Bree Street and all of the other things in the CBD.  It's also conveniently situated in Cape Town where its a cheap Uber ride to other parts of town such as Woodstock  Camps Bay  Clifton  Sea Point  and the VA Waterfront.  And to top it off you have the added benefit of delicious food right outside at the Eastern Food Bazaar. Alan made the entire process painless.  His check-in and check out instruction were thorough and well detailed.  He also provided a guidebook of restaurants and sites to see.  If you are looking for a place to stay in the CBD definitely check out Alan's loft.  If I ever come back to Cape Town I would stay here again.
36347,459372335,2019-05-27,159038046,Samantha,We had a great time staying at Alans place. It is close to a lot of amazing food and great shops. He messaged to ensure we checked in safely and that everything was going well. Hope to be back in Cape town soon and would definitely stay in Alans place again. Thanks
36347,462308939,2019-06-02,15837549,Terence,Alans place was very comfortable and cosy in the center of the city. Lots of options of food and bars within the area. Will definitely stay again if Im back in Cape Town.
36347,466400129,2019-06-09,63135625,Emily,Great location  everything we needed in one little homely spot Thanks
36347,479664614,2019-07-01,5415668,Paige,What a gorgeous space in a fabulous location. I stayed for almost 3 weeks  meaning I had more questions than I normally would as a guest  and Alan was so helpful with everything. Can't wait to come back
200211,564960816005389195,2022-02-18,42965327,Michelle,Beautiful Appartment on a great location. Amazing sea view from on top of the hill. Easy Uber access but also good if you want to work the legs walking up and down hill to the Main Street with restaurants and shops. Appartment is spacious and lots of light coming through. Good beds and cute little details the owner through about. Def a recommendation
200211,580179416978019560,2022-03-11,7943711,Paul,The stay was good
200211,595458949468702992,2022-04-01,244308567,Erik,Very satisified. Great location and hostess
200211,630235985656063644,2022-05-19,22158570,Thabang,Simply wonderful
200211,638875111972848561,2022-05-31,22158570,Thabang,The sunniest sanctuary with sublime views of the ocean to wake up to every day The space is clean and perfectly kitted with everything you could need and comes with the warmest hospitality and treats on arrival from Nespresso pods to croissants and even wine I sure felt at home when I extended my stay from 1  to 6 weeks. Honestly the best air bnb experience Ive ever had. I will definitely be back
200211,718593691760962556,2022-09-18,165234598,Ansolet,Beautiful apartment with everything you need.
200211,791815650176945179,2022-12-28,38064703,Craig,Lovely comfortable apartment. All of Sea Point is within walking distance with tons of restaurants and the Promenade
200211,815755111344338807,2023-01-30,131592355,Gabriel,everything was on point
200211,824413434340013456,2023-02-11,19281922,Hyemin,We enjoyed our stay in this cozy house It was even better than the images and everything we need was well equipped.  Also  the host was easy to communicate and very helpful Flawless
200211,845509086734022114,2023-03-12,222223404,Demi,Anne-Lotte is the best host you can wish for during your stay. She is so friendly and replied super fast to our messages. She also helped us out wherever she could  made sure the rooms were always clean we could let her know when we wanted the appartement to be cleaned and even went to the store for us when we were sick. Moreover  the apartment offers a beautiful view on the ocean and sunset. Also  everything you need for your stay can be found in the apartment  even beach towels  cool boxes  tv with Netflix  washing machine etc. Furthermore  the kitchen is also fully equipped with all you need to cook at home. Last  I always felt safe in the area and at home. The doors were locked with three different locks. All the nice coffee places  restaurants  public swimming pool of Seapoint  the promenade for walking along the sea and even the beach are close by and on walking distance. All in all  I would definitely recommend to stay with Adele. She will make you feel right at home
200211,863588205879538850,2023-04-06,477328259,Louise,Lovely
200211,869442934128752124,2023-04-14,156697773,Aharon,Lovely apartment on top of the hill overlooking Sea Point. Great apartment and location for a remote work setup
200211,1040441850374840710,2023-12-06,48950274,Nicole,Zunchst zum Positiven  die Whg ist schn  die Bilder entsprechen den Gegenenheiten  die Lage ist perfekt. Es ist alles da was man bentigt. Check in und Check out waren sehr flexibel. Wir konnten frher ins Apartment und spter auschecken als angegeben. Unser Kontakt war Adele  die anscheinend das Handling bernommen hat. Adele war erreichbar  aber oft hat es gedauert  was im Regelfall kein Problem ist. Allerdings funktionierte bei uns das Tor nicht  durch das wir Zutritt zur Whg hatten. Wir standen 2x innerhalb und 2x ausserhalb der Anlage und kamen mit unserem Chip nicht raus bzw rein. Geholfen hat uns dann jedes Mal eine Nachbarin in der Anlage  die uns dann auch ihre Remote zum ffnen des Tores gegeben hat. Es ist nicht angenehm im Dunklen ausserhalb des Komplexen zu stehen und nicht reinzukommen. Es ist selbstverstndlich nicht Adeles Schuld  dass das Tor bzw. der Chip nicht immer funktionierte  aber ich htte mir hier deutlich mehr Engagement zur Lsung des Problems gewnscht.
200211,1088963439194121253,2024-02-11,89289651,Cordula,Ruhige Wohnlage und Adele sehr nett und zuvorkommend.
200211,1092635945660168105,2024-02-16,67607912,Christopher,A lovely place to stay away from the CBD. Car ride apps work really well to get to anywhere. We felt incredibly welcomed.
200211,1099924275135528503,2024-02-26,415007198,Mathis,Thank you so much. Our stay was fantastic  the flat is a dream 
200211,1110758479804738067,2024-03-12,39046883,Anne Kiki,We missed our flight and therefore arrived one day later  and it was no problem to check in before 1500. It was me and my friend staying here for little over 1 week to both work and enjoy some free time. The apartment offers enough space to set up 2 workplaces in the living room and WiFi was fast and stable. There is a battery to power the WiFi and charge devices during load shedding  but during our stay luckily this wasnt necessary. The apartment was light and spacious enough for us. We enjoyed the sunset from the living room with windows that slide all the way open and has sun almost all day for as many nights as possible from the big chairs. Location was perfect for us as well and we felt very safe. Adele is a very sweet woman and it was also no problem to check out a bit later. Can highly recommend
218269,1255394,2012-05-09,967589,Ksenia,Beautiful old house with high ceilings  lovely garden and best location  tens of bars and restaurants around the corner  we didn't take a taxi once. Place is full of caring details milk in the fridge  toothpaste in the bathroom and a bunch of apples which I was nibbling on constantly. Guy is a friendly host  picking up and dropping of keys was super easy and we met no problems during our stay. Highly recommended
218269,2471774,2012-10-01,13842,Zev,This house is every bit as charming as pictured. The house is laid out in an open plan  like a studio apartment with high ceilings and a private terrace that I didn't get to use as much as I would have liked because it rained the entire week I was in Cape Town. That said  the fireplace worked really well  and it was nice and cozy indoors. The location was within easy walking distance of restaurants  cafes  bars  supermarket  and laundromats. I rented a car and there was parking right outside though I had to get used to driving up onto the curb. Internet was fast and uncapped  which is rare for South Africa. Guy was a great host and I would recommend his house without hesitation
218269,3565383,2013-02-18,3822890,Katja,We had a really wonderful time at King Street Number 9 We spend lots of time in the little garden with a bottle of wine and a good book. We felt safe all the time  because the apartment is located in a very small street and no strangers walk on by. King Street is a perfect place to stay in Capetown. There are many restaurants and bars nearby and the supermarket is just across the street. By car it took us 10 minutes to drive to the beach  5 minutes to Table Mountain  7 Minutes to Waterfront... We never had a problem finding a parking place - if there was none we parked infront of the door. The key exchange with Guy was easy and he gave us a tip for a really nice bar were we had a really cool evening and a little headache the next day - which was away after a lovely breakfast at Cafe Paradiso with Eggs Benedict and freshly squeezed orange juice and later a good Kaffee Gelado at Vida e Cafe. Come and visit Capetown and stay at King Street Number 9 We will come back some day Katja and Annika
218269,4485358,2013-05-07,6128762,Sanne,If you want to feel at home in the mothercity  head to the pittoresque Kingstreet nr 9. The appartment is equipped with anything you might need  including a bathtub  a patio  fast wifi and even a fireplace. The location is great  you can walk into CBD in 5 min and the cable car station is just up the hill. I have especially enjoyed the lively and safe neighbourhood with bars and restaurants  the wellness mall and nice local creative shopping just around the corner. I will recommend this place highly to anyone who is visiting Capetown and probably feel very jealous at the same time.
218269,4875850,2013-05-30,4129997,Pamela,The house was amazing. We really enjoyed the fire place and the excellent location
218269,191126267,2017-09-06,15694960,Jan Willem,We had an excellent stay here Lovely apartment in a perfect location  just the right size for two people. Communications were great  Don is super friendly and made us feel welcome right away.
218269,193952319,2017-09-15,74561754,Jarryd,Excellent place to be based in Cape Town. Central but not in the thick of it. Very reasonable taxi rank outside of the place but also Uber via wifi extremely well priced. Great shops nearby and bars restaurants with little to no noise even though I was staying over a weekend. As a lone traveller I felt very safe and well connected to my host. Thank you
218269,197643184,2017-09-26,105334844,Jaco,Great location. Parking a challenge.
218269,202616612,2017-10-12,10185573,Hollyn,I had a wonderful stay at Don  Guy's place. It's perfectly centrally located in the heart of the trendy Kloof StGardens area  with so much within walking distance and easy Uber access to anywhere. The space is creatively decorated  with lovely light fixtures and modern touches. The flat has absolutely everything you might need. Don met me right away and was flexible with his schedule to accommodate my check in and out times and was also available on text in case of anything. He also helped me to try and sort the internet challenges. This space has wonderful value for money  was mostly very quiet and the design just makes you feel very happy I would absolutely stay here again  as its a lovely place for a long-term stay. I highly recommend this for a single person or couple and you'll be so pleased with the space
218269,203974399,2017-10-16,21397258,Philip,Lovely and spacey apartment just as described and the pictures don't do it justice  it's even nicer from an also super nice host  The location is brilliant  close to a lot of bars  restaurants and everything else you'll need. The area also is safe so you can just walk everywhere  even at night. We enjoyed our stay very much and can only recommend it. We'll be back.
218269,206854442,2017-10-27,9481580,Sophie  Fabian,We had a relaxing time on King Street. The apartment is spacious and is equipped with everything you need. The location is fantastic at any time of day or night you can move safely and great restuarants  bars and shops are not far away. Unfortunately  there were some constructions going on on the small street so that it was sometimes very noisy.
218269,207495635,2017-10-29,5879046,Lino,lovely apartment  great location  nice people
218269,216848575,2017-12-06,136967230,Isobel,An amazing house in a great location with everything you could need. Don was more than helpful and great fun. Loads of lovely places to eat near by.
218269,218137938,2017-12-11,70930510,Taryn,Lovely location. Perfect for exploring the city. Quiet. Vibey. Just right.
218269,221619963,2017-12-27,37808150,Michael Westberg,The apartment is situated on a quiet and safe side street to the lively Kloof St. This location was perfect for exploring Cape Town  which we mainly relied on Uber for. The apartment itself is beautifully decorated with a lot of nice touches  and it had all amenities that we needed.
218269,225696700,2018-01-07,25408170,Claire,Such an amazing place to stay.  Guy is such a personable person and the place is everything you would want. Safe  central and hip
218269,226174686,2018-01-09,111245719,Ghia,Fantastic location  comfortable stay  will definitely visit again
218269,227782678,2018-01-16,152743866,James,The small dead end street is quiet and charming and safe. The location is great for the city bowl  as well as for getting over to Clifton or Camps Bay  and there is a real nice neighbourhood vibe here  with good shops  making it all super easy. I slept well here too. Perfect place for a single or a couple.
218269,242513584,2018-03-12,4271758,Tucker,The space is awesome  well located  and a perfect entry point for those wishing to explore the best Cape Town has to offer. Could not have asked for better  and if I come back hope I will  i'd love to make this my base for a few more days.
218269,246252303,2018-03-25,8104887,Jonas,A secret little street from busy Kloof Street neighboring stylish boutique hotels. Walking distance everywhere. Uber  don't take a car due to parking.
218269,251640334,2018-04-08,34198960,Charlotte,Stayed here for almost two weeks with my partner. The studio is absolutely perfect for a couple and has everything you need and is extremely well planned and decorated. Location is top notch if you want to be close to everything. Hosts are so thoughtful and responsive. The only thing I would say is that if you are someone who wants to sleep in to later than 7-8 AM then this might not be the place for you if you are a light sleeper. Even though its very calm for being in the middle of the hustle and bustle you do have nextdoor staff using the street outside in the morning. Did not bother us though as we get up early in the morning We will definitely come back to this place
36347,489607302,2019-07-17,199918286,Avron,This apartment lives up to its name being very cosy  what I really loved about it  is that its different. Everything in such throughout detail from the positioning of the bed to decor on the wall. I really enjoyed my stay here
36347,490713681,2019-07-19,139297036,Salem,great place to stay in Cape town
36347,493383757,2019-07-22,276874525,Alexandra,Alan's loft was the perfect place to stay for a trip to Cape Town. It's in a great spot in the city and had all the amenities I needed for a chilly weekend during Cape Town's winter.
36347,494311908,2019-07-24,268187129,Hugh,Fun place with super creative vibe.  Worth the climb to reach the 7th floor. Good central location in the heart of the city.
36347,500993871,2019-08-03,21186588,Elizabeth,Loved this stylish flat in the heart of the CBD. The high ceilings and modern design were lovely. Alan was a great host  super helpful and communicative. Definitely would book again
36347,508114559,2019-08-12,184836867,Deji,Thanks for allowing me to stay at your spot. Please see my private note.
36347,509379762,2019-08-14,29808151,Tim,The apartment itself is very stylish and modern. However  it is located in a pretty urban part of Cape Town and the front door had locking issues while I was staying there which didn't feel safe.
36347,513870247,2019-08-20,156213658,Lindy,It was a great stay and a unique space.
36347,518893258,2019-08-27,238207699,Tobias,Super apartment with a very nice host.

36347,546080548,2019-10-13,135494540,Tomas,Quirky loft space that was different but cozy and contained. Loved the little balcony and mountain views. So central and convenient  a perfect place to explore Cape Town and the surrounding features.

There is a fully equipped kitchen and the cottage has a small patio in the back to have a coffee or a sigaret. But there is no real need to stay home since all the coffee places and restaurants are just around the corner. From here you can easily walk into town.

218269,562681986,2019-11-11,11770309,Carolyn,Wonderful home away from home during our stay in Cape Town. The apartment is gorgeous and well-decorated  with a beautiful courtyard and well-appointed kitchen. The open layout was perfect for me and my husband. The apartment is in a great locationon a small  quiet steet steps from all the bars  restaurants  and shops on Kloof Street and at the base of Table Mountain. One of our favorite AirBnB stays yet
218269,589963461,2020-01-07,188680141,Burkhard,I lived and worked at the flat for two months and enjoyed every day of it. This is a place where you really feel at home. I loved the little court yard with all the plants. The neighbourhood is safe and friendly with many good restaurants and bars at walking distance. Don is a very nice and efficient host who always reacted quickly to my requests. I would come back any time.
218269,612715112,2020-03-01,4119946,Bianca,Verry Nice spot
218269,614704676,2020-03-06,16449237,Bernd,Wonderful stay at this nice spot. Very much love for details and best communication with a host I ever had. I definitely recommend the stay here love the little patio.
218269,617921294,2020-03-14,2832214,Adam,Don our host was simply amazing. Response to questions within 5mins maybe less. We stayed here just as the Corona Virus was kicking off globally. Don was a reassuring Cape Town resident who went above and beyond to make sure we were safe and looked after. Thank you so much. Book this place or any of their places. Best Air BnB experience I have had yet.
218269,717561441,2020-12-23,17244536,J.,Great location and apartment. It was very easy to check-in and check-out. Weve been in contact with Don who was very friendly and responsive Would highly recommend.
218269,739992047,2021-03-18,26514246,Ingo,I spent 5 weeks at this lovely place and it was just perfect. Right in the middle of everything but very quiet and safe. Easy to find parking space nearby. The place is very tasteful decorated with everything you need for a comfortable stay. I enjoyed the little terrace very much. And the very good bed allows a healthy sleep.
218269,752769823,2021-04-28,58407223,Stacy,I had a wonderful month staying in this apartment. Its a lovely home and very quiet and the neighbors that live or work near by are all so sweet and helpful. You can walk everywhere and its right near Kloof Street  but its safe and private. The hosts are all wonderful and I would definitely recommend staying here if you like being in town and want to explore Cape Town.
218269,756493440,2021-05-09,17501921,Mark,Great location.
218269,405562717950716733,2021-07-13,53161594,Anna,This is a beautiful  well-equipped  and comfortable heritage apartment in central Cape Town. It's a quick walk to many shops and restaurants in non-lockdown times  but also sufficiently out of the way to be quiet at nights. In essence  it does everything it says on the packaging I'd especially recommend this stay for shorter-term travelers. I spent a month here in the middle of winter  and found some things - slightly patchy internet  trash disposal  only one set of bed linen - more challenging to manage in a work-from-home context. But Don did his best to accommodate me under difficult circumstances  and I think anyone staying here would be in good hands.
218269,462104369414626639,2021-09-29,104501606,Sebastian,Had a great stay at Don's place. The best location ever to explore Cape Town
218269,545382967669785240,2022-01-22,192567870,Nate,Super nice host  great place.
218269,596867555028888627,2022-04-03,30841133,Charlotte,I really enjoyed my stay at Don and Jacos place. The location could not be more central  while at the same time feeling very safe. Don was an amazing host  responding super fast to any questions and requests I had.
218269,606984375623092627,2022-04-17,7583435,Claire,Loved my two weeks at Don and Jacos place Was the perfect size for me and had all the amenities I needed. It was also very well located - on a cute cobblestone lane off Kloof street  near lovely restaurants and cafes  table mountain  and just a short Uber ride away from everything else.
218269,615692438307418651,2022-04-29,75335759,Ellemieke,We had a really nice stay in the apartment. It is on a great location in a very cute street. Your in the middle of everything but at the same time quiet. We enjoyed the patio for breakfast and coffee and the fresco bread every mornign from the nearby supermarket. With Uber every corner in Capetown was easily reached. Don was very flexible and fast in his communication. We recommend this place
218269,656345466319745697,2022-06-24,449125636,Natalie,We loved our stay. Location is great for everything. Lots of food options for eating out or takeaway. Views were amazing all around us. Great walks up the mountains. Super comfy bed. Thoughtful and speedy communication. Totally recommend 
218269,692560531166015497,2022-08-13,37431953,Berta,Don and Jaco are great hosts The arrival was easy. Since I arrived they made sure I was comfortable. Communication was very easy and they were available for whatever problem or question. Actually  I had a problem with the wifi but they solved it very efficently. A part from that  the cottage is exactly how is it show in the pictures. It has everything you need. Very well located in a quiet steet. I couldn't imagine a better place to stay in Cape Town. Thank so much.
218269,718690232915704239,2022-09-18,35277401,Alina,Dons place is lovely  we absolutely enjoyed our stay here. The location of this flat is perfect  we used the car much less than anticipated. The communication with don was great as well  we locked ourselves out once and he organized help asap. Highly recommend
218269,749859780948528070,2022-10-31,47969151,Michiel,Great spot  in a safe quiet little street. Perfect to work remotely  discover the city or enjoy a small braai.
218269,760011913939422156,2022-11-14,25950431,Evan,Overall this place is great. The location is hard to beat as its right in the middle of Gardens on Kloof and Don is great to communicate with if you need anything. What could be improved is that the door is really old so the wind constantly makes a banging noise  and it has large cracks around the edges so you get a lot of outside noise. The hot water pressure is really low as well  which doesn't make for a great shower. Other than those things the place is perfect.
218269,782415393746218880,2022-12-15,10450807,Evgeniya,Very nice and convenient cottage. In the very central part  but in quiet blind end  so not noisy at all. Everything needed and a beautiful small yard. Very comfortable expensive pillows  matrass and bedsheets feels like home.  Friendly owners. Will definitely miss this place
218269,804119693689441406,2023-01-14,201800761,Sazi,Id stay here over and over again. What amazing hosts
218269,814998927195546638,2023-01-29,3453929,David,I loved my stay in the cottage. You cant beat the location for cafes and restaurants. Everything you need is no more than 5-10 minutes out of your door. The neighborhood provides easy access to all the attractions in Cape Town. The space is comfortable and very safe. I hope the cottage is available on my next visit to Cape Town. I will definitely stay there again.
218269,851267070706986285,2023-03-20,16755498,Travis,Great stay in the Gardens Wonderful neighborhood with many places within walking distance. Highly recommend this place
218269,866539024629877381,2023-04-10,440539672,Emma,Very safe spot in Cape Town  super close to Kloof street but overall very quiet. Don is very responsive and helpful  which is great. Would recommend
218269,875915257102304931,2023-04-23,112011849,Nicholas,Perfect place to stay in Cape Town. Right off Kloof street with dozens of restaurants and cafes within walking distance  safe to walk around daynight and centrally located for a short drive to any other areas of Cape Town. Don is an incredible host and was very helpful. The place is spacious and has everything you would need or want in a stay.
218269,880280316024354330,2023-04-29,75335759,Ellemieke,Last year we stayed a week in the apartment of Don and Jaco and this year again. Our home away from home. In one of the cutest alleys of Cape Town  near all the nice restaurants of Kloofstreet. Easy to get an uber to other sites. Spacious apartment with nice patio. Really recommended
218269,887502895471606549,2023-05-09,74893694,Jake,Comfortable and safe location for a first time visit to Cape Town. Check in instructions were detailed and accurate  and the light in the alley even during loadshedding makes it safe to come and go anytime. WiFi is hit or miss when loadshedding kicks in  but otherwise was easy to connect.
36347,732773081,2021-02-20,44768838,Megan,Cool  modern place great for couples. Stylish space and well laid out for a small room. Would only recommend to young  fit mobile people. Not ideal for young kids or elderly. Pretty steep ladder to the bed and low ceiling above the bed so takes a bit of concentration not to fall But really awesome and enjoyed it. Convenient location.
36347,396138499780255213,2021-06-30,2146751,Mary,Lovely space. I had a wonderful  long stay.
36347,954947241278072602,2023-08-10,134234279,Alison,I arrived just at sunset. I wanted to wake up and have my coffee  which requires creamer  which I had forgotten to bring.  I was advised not to go out in the dark by myself  which meant no creamer for my coffee in the am.  However  Alan had picked up two things from the grocery store for his guest  mandarine oranges and creamer I was delighted. The place was fantastic. I loved it. I took pictures and videos because it gave me lots of ideas. I met many fantastic locals at the coffee shop just around the corner conversations were magical as I  a single woman  dreamed they would be traveling alone in Africa. The brother of the owner of the coffee shop  TK  even gave me R70 cash when my ride arrived but didn't accept credit cards.  TK paid him and told me that I could pay him back later.  Amazing hospitality. I had just met him 24 hrs. earlier. What a first impression of downtown Cape Town and the merchants and locals who live there. Wonderful Thank you  Alan.
36347,963645148249940581,2023-08-22,292874377,Samantha,This accommodation was great It looked just like the pictures and it was very cozy and had a stunning view of the mountains When I was in the building I felt very safe and comfortable  the only thing to note is that its not located in the safest part of town and if you are a woman it did not seem very safe to walk alone  even during the day  but if you are planned to Uber everywhere then this accommodation would be fine for you Also the gym and pool are in a separate building across the street.
36347,992579862033834730,2023-10-01,170203370,Ireon,Alans beautiful loft flat comes at a great deal with even better service. He was always accessible via message and quick to respond to any questions or needs at any time of day. The location is just in the center of everything  very secure and private and unaffected by load shedding as well. I had a long stay and there was a cleaning service every week - she is very friendly and also available to the guest throughout your stay for any questions or concerns. The loft very quickly began to feel like home. Informative host  prime location  great price 1010. Thank you Alan I plan to book in the future
36347,999855242014621311,2023-10-11,67880033,Rob,Absolutely loved the apartment The vibe and cozy atmosphere  coupled with the fantastic view of Table Mountain  made for a delightful stay. The location is excellent  and the instructions provided were incredibly clear. Connie and Alan were also exceptionally available  with Connie going above and beyond to assist me after 9 pm when I believed my keys were stolen along with my bag. Her prompt response saved me from having to spend the night outside. Highly recommended
36347,1031037627246256529,2023-11-23,18458597,Alan,Really great apartment I felt very at home in. Would recommend particularly for someone travelling alone and for business.
36347,1045519995144025546,2023-12-13,239281671,Hollie,Funky place - good for a solo traveller or couple. I stayed with a friend so one of us had to go on the smaller bed which wasn't very comfortable but if it had of just been me it would have been great. Awesome TV with netflix. Decent place to stay if you want to be based in the CBD. Secure building - very easy to access.
36347,1073831070138920855,2024-01-21,22166145,Lena,Die Unterkunft war super schn und von dort konnte man alles gut und einfach erreichen. Danke Alan -
36347,1103448091529817777,2024-03-02,71223172,Allison,I stayed here for a few nights by myself and it was absolutely perfect There were so many restaurants  cafes  and shops within walking distance which made it very easy to get around. It's a great loft in an urban environment with everything you need. The place felt really secure and comfortable which I appreciated as a solo traveler
36347,1129595509253029563,2024-04-07,24433315,Timon,I loved staying here. The apartment nicely decorated and I felt right at home from the start.
36347,1135403893274040566,2024-04-15,336986621,Noor,Its been lovely to stay in this apartment. The Interior is incredible and we felt directly at home. Everything was clean and very comfortable. Theres also some recommendations and tips prepared for us. The terasse had a wonderful view of the table mountain and the location of the apartment was surprisingly calm  seeing that its in the centre of capetown. The host was easily reachable  and weve appreciated flexible check-in times. And were especially grateful for the quick help when I forgot my passport 
36347,1155013230898771738,2024-05-12,39219145,Sarah,Comfortable studio which feels like a secret spot in the eaves of the city
218269,1007773136813104089,2023-10-22,31106243,Natalie,Stayed for two nights and had a perfect place to explore the city from this cute cottage. Vibrant area incl. nightlife with many cool locations in walking distance. Still a quiet place to relax and rest. Stylish interior meeting all the requirements needed to feel at home. Don and Jaco were very responsive and inviting from the beginning on and you could right away feel that they are great hosts. Definitely a place worth staying and we will reconsider them for sure if we get back to Cape Town one day. Thank you guys. It was a pleasure. Hugs MN
218269,1014392711161431125,2023-10-31,49542792,Jacques,The place is in a great location. Has everything you might need. There is a nice city buzz at night and over weekends. At moments some noise from the hotel and restaurants in the road  but it did not bother me at all. It actually contributed to a very nice buzz and atmosphere. Their internet is stable and was great for working online and watching movies. The apartment is comfortable. Don's communication was excellent. Not a moment of needing to ask for something or wondering about things. He is proactive in sending recommendations and all information you need.
218269,1018729365222386651,2023-11-06,7668569,Jen,Fantastic  safe location and super comfy bed Host was very friendly and proactive with giving recommendations and helping us settle in.

When we arrived we were surprised to find that the apartment is even nicer than the pictures  and curated with so much love for detail that we felt immediately like home. Don  Jaco were amazing hosts  Don provided us not only with clear check-in instructions but also recommended us places in the area and events for first Thursday which we really appreciated Furthermore Don was always super quick to respond and help with any questions we had. We loved our stay and cant wait to come back

231402,811845,2011-12-29,1270546,Olle,Unique apartment with an extraordinary view. Perfect hospitality to the point of repeately exceeding expectations. And  not the least  a fantastic coffee machine much appreciated by Europeans
231402,865624,2012-01-16,1541696,Emilia,Lovely apartment with fantastic view. Quiet street within walking distance to great cafes and restaurants and the VA waterfront.
231402,951414,2012-02-27,1424607,David,I revisited South Africa for the first time in some years and on my first major holiday from Scotland following a major cancer operation in 2011. Travelling with an old friend we stayed for 9 nights in the Braeside loft apartment. We could not have found  higher quality  better located and more comfortable accommodation. There could be no better host than Stuart who was on hand if needed but otherwise completely respected our privacy   The apartment had everything we needed with marvellous views. A real gem where we will certainly stay again on future visits to Cape Town
231402,1031794,2012-03-22,481336,Jen,The loft is beautiful  clean  and in a great location. Stuart was there to greet us and show us around and was very welcoming. The views of the ocean  mountains  and stadium are incredible  and it's convenient  to a lot of Cape Town attractions. The loft has everything you could need.
231402,1135593,2012-04-16,844607,Francisco,We went to Capetown in our honeymoon and I must say that Stuart's housse could not be best. For us it was the perfect place to stay. It is not only in a perfect location but also has great views  a wonderful terrace and it is a beautiful place. We can only say great things about his place and about Stuart. We would love to go back there and stay in Braeside House.
231402,1417603,2012-06-05,1638050,Valerie,We had such a wonderful time   Braeside house loft is amazing So beautiful and cosy  and also well equiped.  The view is stunning  It is close to the waterfront and lots of restaurants.  Stuart has been very welcoming and helpful. We definitively would like to come back
231402,1476031,2012-06-13,214918,Kurt,This place was great. Very convenient location. nice view of the ocean and from the back balcony  a view of Signal Hill.  You can tell a lot of love and attention to detail was put into remodeling the attic of this house into a spacious and comfortable space. Lots of light from windows and sky lights  comfortable bed  handy having a washer and drier  beautiful wood floors  warm bathroom floor  great little cafe for breakfast just around the corner. parking
231402,2510209,2012-10-05,1622695,Johannes,es war super schn dort wir verbrachten fnf nchte im loft apartment  genossen dessen gemtliche atmosphre  den blick auf die bucht und hatten sehr schnell das gefhl  zu hause zu sein
231402,2617558,2012-10-15,3288099,Heather,The Braeside loft is a phenomenal place to stay. I felt immediately at home and made the most of everything it had to offer. Excellent touches like espresso machine  fluffy robes and slippers  heated bathroom floor  juice  bread  milk and eggs in the fridge on arrival...the loft has been designed to perfectly accommodate a visitor. Great location  quiet  parking  fantastic views. Wifi a bit spotty  but I muddled through. And as a non smoker it was a little bit of a bummer to smell smoke drifting up from downstairs  but I would certainly stay there again and have already recommended it to another friend. A perfect home base from which to see Cape Town.
231402,2735014,2012-10-28,2598489,Jan,Braeside Loft Apartment was a wonderfull place to stay in Capetown. We had a very good time 10 days in this spacious apartment in October. Everything was ok. Nice bed  good bathroom  lovely view over Cape Town Stadium and Signal Hill. Good coffeemachine. From the apartment all the highlights of Cape Town were in reach. If we go to Cape Town next time and we certainly will  we will try to stay in the Loft apartment again
231402,4136301,2013-04-13,4262305,Rama,The Braeside loft is a perfect home base for exploring the city  in one of the best neighborhoods. The views are enough to stay put - very comfortable. The one touch espresso machine is quite convenient. Getting a good wifi signal can be done in the bedroom  or in the stairwell  but is spotty elsewhere. Stuart lives in the lower 23rds of the house and was attentive if anything was needed. If you are new to the city  take the 'Red Bus tour' to get familiar with the lay of the land  with many sights and attractions The price seems low when compared to other accommodations. Would stay again for the views alone.
231402,4507117,2013-05-09,3413592,Marts,Nice place Communication with Stuart was easy and he responded to my question immediately and gave phone number of trustful taxi company  as fair taxis might be a problem in Cape Town. Loft apartment was very spacious and extremely well equipped with everything You might need for cooking and convenient living. Private parking in front of house also is very convenient and You can reach all places of Cape Town within minutes. If some day will go back to Cape Town would like to stay there again
231402,6195433,2013-08-03,6956461,Victoria,My husband and I stayed in the loft apartment for one week at the end of July  and had a great time. The apartment is very spacious and well equipped with wonderful views across Green Point to the sea. Lots of great restaurants within easy walking distance. We would recommmend it to anyone
231402,7674521,2013-09-29,8544908,Carmen,Very nice appartment Very nice landlord
231402,8273985,2013-10-23,1993530,Kristina,Stuarts apartment is wonderful The view is amazing and the location is simply perfect. Enough space for 2 people - even for more Very clean and cozy. We loved it there Stuart lives downstairs but we haven't seen him during our stay. Perfect if you need time for yourself  but if you want to have someone local around to spend the evening with  this won't be the place.
231402,8327910,2013-10-26,7736719,Susanne,it was just perfect We had wonderful days there The location of the apartment - its very central Thank a lot  Stuart  for hosting us at your place.
231402,8831802,2013-11-20,8576403,Marit,We loved the Braeside Loft Perfect location with a Nice sunny balcony. Very nice atmosfere  it is a great place to stay and feel at home after exploring the beautifull Capetown.
231402,9113252,2013-12-08,30744,Andre,This apartments in a great location  with a beautiful view. It is walking distance to the VA waterfront and the parking spot is key for car friendly Cape town. We'd stay here again in a second.
231402,9303451,2013-12-20,3637411,Shawn,Stuart has a real winner here  Braeside was a wonderful place to stay -- clean  sunny  breezy  and close to Green Point amenities.  The pictures don't do it justice the loft apartment and indeed the entire house will exceed your expectations.
231402,9380246,2013-12-25,3728572,Carly,We had a great stay at Stuart's flat. He left us with some handy info and the location is perfect for seeing Cape Town. You can walk to the waterfront which is perfect.  Overall a great stay and wonderful flat. Thanks Stuart x
231402,9899113,2014-01-18,1816722,Andrew  Coralie,The perfect home base for a Cape Town vacationadventure I say home base because it really felt like a complete house. For 2 people over 5 days it was more than enough for us to enjoy our time in Cape Town with ease. Stuart was extremely accommodating  even with our changing check-in and check-out times. There was also a cleaner in on 2 of the days so our place was spotless over our stay. Location wise  Green Point is really central to everything and the place is within walking distance to groceries and restaurants. That being said we had a rented car and I believe that is essential to really get to see the city and all the beautiful areas around it. The last few things before I forget is that this loft has amazing views to wake up to and we really enjoyed the style of it. Everything was where it should be kind of like a sailboat. Stuart has gone to great lengths to make sure there is nothing missing.
231402,11635558,2014-04-10,2158793,Stefan,Stuart was a friendly host  the apartment is very nice
231402,14219805,2014-06-15,8618908,Kandice,Our experience was awesome After camping for a week it was just what we needed. The location was great  about a mile or so from downtown which was an easy walk. The apartment was very nice and comfortable  and the views were amazing. Stuart also had a few items in the fridge for us since we arrived so late eggs  bread  OJ We enjoyed eating breakfast and occasionally dinner at home  which was exactly why we chose to stay in an apartment like this. For the price  it can't be beat Stuart was great  very flexible and easy to work with. The additional parking spot was also nice to have  so we didn't have to worry about on street parking. Thank you for a great trip
231402,15589466,2014-07-12,16868947,Justin,Braeside House is the perfect place to stay in Cape Town. Close to all amenities  great views of the sea and signal hill and very comfortable and well equipped. The bedroom is very cosy and the underfloor heating in the bathroom is a real bonus in winter.
231402,16720453,2014-08-01,1001435,Sybren,The braeside loft is an incredibly nice place to stay in Cape Town. The view is gorgeous and the apartment itself is top notch Communication with Stuart was easy and quick. If I'd have to stay in Cape Town again I'd make sure to book this loft in advance
231402,18236858,2014-08-24,14016370,Deborah,My sister and I arrived late at night to Braeside  and this was our very first Airbnb experience  and our first time to Cape Town  so we weren't sure how it would all be.  Well  Stuart was there to greet us and he showed us around the loft apartment and then let us settle in.  The apartment was very spacious and comfortable and clean and he supplied us with a starter breakfast two eggs  milk  butter and a loaf of bread  and plenty of coffee in a cool coffee machine  The twin beds were very comfortable and cozy and warm  much appreciated in the cool winter weather  The apartment had a spectacular view looking north over Green Point park towards Robben Island  and a nice back deck from which we enjoyed our sunsets on a few fine days.  We loved the location we were not right in the down town area  so it felt quiet at night  yet it was very easy to catch a myciti bus  and the Hop on Hop Off bus stops were not too far away. We loved our morning walks to the Waterfront  which was about 20 minutes away  and we felt very safe walking in the area.  There were only a few issues the dryer did not seem to work on the washerdryer  and we couldn't get the oven to light  but Stuart was quick to look into both these problems  and generally we felt he was very gracious and available when we had questions about how to get around and where to find things.  I just loved our stay at the loft apartment
231402,18626370,2014-08-29,19235362,Naveen,Wonderful place. Truly magical We stayed at Braeside loft for a week.
231402,19155783,2014-09-07,14940752,Greg,The loft was even more spacious than we expected  and a perfect location from which to explore Cape Town. Stuart was helpful in orienting us when we checked in and gave us plenty of space and privacy to do our own thing. We would definitely return on our next visit to Cape Town
231402,20697575,2014-10-04,20462735,Lucie,I had an awesome time at Braeside House. It was great value for money
231402,21580254,2014-10-20,787551,Anna,Fantastic place Stuart was the perfect host. This apartment was so charming. My favorite place I've ever stayed on airbnb. I wanted to move in. Great views  lovely deck  cosy sleeping room  charming decor and wonderful little touches that made it special. I wish we had spent longer there - it is our one regret for our three week trip in South Africa. Pictures don't do this place justice. When I return to capetown I'll definitely stay again
231402,22297032,2014-11-03,20876520,Viola,That was an excellent choice. Braeside House is lovely situated in Greenpoint opposite to the stadium. I stayed in the Loft Appartement and everything was arranged perfectly. I loved the balcony with view on Signal Hill where i really enjoyed having my morning coffee. The apartment was very clean an the Maid cam twice a week to change towels and duvets  so the only thing you have to do is get relaxed and enjoy Captown. I will definitely will come back to Braeside House. Thanks Stuart for the excellent stay
231402,22942880,2014-11-18,1922503,Marc,Deeply impressed It was such an extraordinary apartment. You have a wonderful view to the ocean  you are near by to the hotspots of cape town and with Stuart you will have one of the best hosts ever. Thanks for making our stay such an unforgettable one.
231402,23060678,2014-11-22,20365915,Gunar,Sehr schne Wohnung  die die Erwartungen sogar noch bertraf. Von der Dachterrasse ein schner Blick auf den Signal-Hill  vom Schlafzimmer und Wohnbereich sieht man den Atlantik mit Robben Island. Wir wurden von Stuart und Tarisai sehr nett empfangen sogar mit groem Blumenstrau und fhlten uns vom ersten Augenblick sehr wohl.
231402,23318220,2014-11-29,4127722,Herbert,Perfect host welcomes you and tells you all things necessary for your stay and then he disappears till you leave. The loft is spacious and very cozy. Absolutely great view from the large front window over the waterfront and Greenpoint. Quiet Veranda. Kitchen  TV and Wifi exactly as in the description. A perfect place to explore Capetown.
231402,24457914,2014-12-29,17540283,Raymond,The place was truly wonderful.  A superb loft conversion  much more spacious than the pictures than the photos suggest  with great views front and back.  The beds - including the drop-down - were  very comfortable  the bath robes and towels comparable to a 5 star hotel.  Though we did not cook much the kitchen was very well equipped  the coffee machine an extra treat and the washing machine and dishwasher unexpected bonuses.  We were made to feel extremely welcome from the moment we arrived milk and bread in the fridge  Stuart was around but never intrusive and the maid  Tererai  very sweet.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable and memorable stay in CPT.
231402,25491042,2015-01-18,18459194,Doris,Stuart ist ein wirklich sehr angenehmer Gastgeber. Auf die Frage ob es mglich sei auf dem Balkon zu grillen wurde uns sofort ein nagelneuer Grill und Grillutensilien hingestellt.Die Wohnung ist einfach nur wunderschn  super gelegen und hat einen atemberaubenden Ausblick. Sollten wir noch einmal nach Kapstadt zurckkehren gbe es fr uns nur eine Wohnung in welcher wir unterkommen wollten Ein perfekter Urlaub alles hat reibungslos funktioniert Danke
743795,1089781826064351826,2024-02-12,40205770,Hannah,Absolutely gorgeous space A home away from home. Zacs place truly is special - a stones throw away from everything. Peaceful  serene and spacious - cannot wait to be back. Great communication w Zac through out my stay. Cannot wait to be back. 
743795,1091944773959743192,2024-02-15,85384982,Londeka,1010 air bnb felt like home - highly recommended and the interior is straight out of a magazine
751785,23643768,2014-12-07,15667649,Jennifer,The place was very nice. In a great neighborhood and it had beautiful views Having to pick up and drop off keys at a separate location was difficult. We had trouble finding the apartment and know one seemed to be able to help us though the numbers we called.
751785,25969015,2015-01-31,5713964,Martijn,Had to pick up the keys from a external agency  which is actually pretty close to the apartment 5 min drive. We were about 2 hours early but it was no problem getting the keys  communication was good. The apartment is amazing  very clean  spacious  big balcony  fantastic view on table mountain and around the corner from Kloof Street with nice bars  restaurants and everything else you need.
231402,25651785,2015-01-22,3421296,Mirko,We have been very happy in the apartment of Stuart The location is great - the view to the sea and to the stadium is unbelievable. The roof top garden is also great for breakfast Thanks also for the small helpers in the beginning  like butter  orange juice  milk and water If we return I would be happy to stay here again
231402,26350090,2015-02-10,1412794,Jan,Very Nice apartment Light  airy and well appointed. Wifi works great  balcony is very private and sunny. Bedding is good too. Location is quiet but you could walk to the waterfront  however taxi is very cheap in Cape Town
231402,27322003,2015-03-02,24591858,Rachel,The loft house was perfect for our vacation. We felt very safe in the area and it was a great location. The loft was well equipped with everything we needed. Stuart had some basic items like milk  orange juice  eggs in the refrigerator when we arrived which was a great unexpected add We highly recommend staying with Stuart.
231402,27511945,2015-03-06,3268086,Shaurja,I had a really great 4 night stay at Stuart's apartment  a warm  cozy place but bigger than it looks in the pictures and has great views. Easy walking distance from the main restaurants and bars in Green Point. The location is very quiet and I felt safe walking at night. Stuart was there upon check-in and very helpful as a few minor issues came up during my stay but were dealt with promptly. I would definitely stay again
231402,28800091,2015-03-30,15104953,Beth,Everything was as advertised if not better.  We stayed for 6 nights.  They tidied up at least 3 times while we were out of the loft.  Pretty views from front and back.  All the amenities required or desired.  We had a fantastic time during your stay.
231402,30027528,2015-04-16,8481077,Zeke,Nice place  great location
231402,30400946,2015-04-21,6320698,Josephine,We stayed in Stuart's beautiful and cozy apartment for three nights - the first few days in South Africa and got to know Cape Town from its best side. It is a nice neighborhood  well connected to the myciti Bus lines - we made it to the Apartment from the airport easily. Overall  the Loft is very well equipped  I loved the design and details of the layout of the apartment. However  the best thing is the amazing view from the bed room when waking up in the morning. We will definitely get back here next time we're in town.
231402,32083250,2015-05-13,25935765,Peni,Stuart is a great host who made sure we had everything we needed - including stocking the kitchen with a few welcome essentials.  The location is perfect for exploring any part of Cape Town and surprisingly quiet considering how close it is to the main road.  The Loft is really spacious and well equipped including a really comfy bed.  We will definitely be back to stay when we next travel to Cape Town.
231402,38701805,2015-07-18,856079,Lulu,My partner and I stayed here a few years ago and loved it so much that we booked it again for our next trip to Cape Town.  The location is perfect for exploring and the apartment is charming and cosy with lovely views.  We hope to be back again soon
231402,40084605,2015-07-28,1645574,Jane,The location was great close to all the things we wanted to see  the Braeside House Loft was lovel  very cosey with all the  things we needed. The welcome from Stuart could be a little more friendly   made us feel like we were interrupting his day and it was a bit of a bother to show us around.
231402,46375591,2015-09-10,9921633,Jeff,This place is stunning. The photos do not do it justice. Fantastic neighborhood. Didn't feel unsafe once. All communications were super professional. No hassles at all.
231402,47265770,2015-09-17,28367068,Stephanie,What a wonderful place to stay Stuart was very easy going  and great with communications.  The apartment is bigger than it looks in the pictures Great location  perfect for a stay in Cape Town  would definitely come back here again
231402,48532259,2015-09-27,1922594,Dominik,This place is even better than it looks on the pictures. The loft is beautifully fitted into the roof of this nice house and is quite spacious. Making the necessary arrangement for my stay with Stuart went very smoothly. My favorite was the beautiful view out of both the bed room and the living room. I tried to book right away for my next stay
751785,49229367,2015-10-02,32487201,Otto,Stunning views Comfortable  neat  all necessary appliances. Prompt service.
751785,83882026,2016-07-04,29719219,Daniel,The apartment lies in a central but quit area of cape town. Perfect for relaxed days and all the trips you can do in beautiful cape town. The apartment is very cosy and clean and equipped with all the things you need. At last there is this amazing lookout to the tafelberg.
231402,51554942,2015-10-21,44855501,Kai,Great accomodation. Stuart kept some fresh orange juice  milk  eggs and bread for us. You have a wonderful view over green point in the front and signal hill in the back. For a next stay in capetown we would definetely take Stuarts appartement again.
231402,53175340,2015-11-06,15712096,Oliver,Great apartment with an amazing view. Everything you need for a lovely stay. Stuart got us settled and helped us out with our requests. Would definitely come back here.
231402,53878750,2015-11-14,42276198,Keith,The loft is spacious with great views and located just a short drive from downtown Cape Town and from the VA Waterfront.  Stuart's communication before our arrival was great and on our arrival he showed us around the apartment and got us settled.  A comprehensive pamphlet helped answer some questions WiFi password etc as well as give us some information shops and restaurants on the immediate surrounding area.  Parking and driving on the narrow streets was a bit of an adventure but never a major problem.  We enjoyed our stay and would happily book the loft again if we return to Cape Town.
231402,56111406,2015-12-09,5287320,Michael,The loft is just great and the pictures on here don't do it justice. You could spend the whole day on the terrace which has sun from breakfast early in the morning until Braai time in the evening and easily fits four people. The beds are comfy and you'll find everything you need to make the most out of your Cape Town experience. Many supermarkets  shops  liquor stores  bars and restaurants are just around the corner  travelling in and around Cape Town with your car is easy due to the central location of the apartment. Some of the city's sights are even just a short walk away. We had a really good time staying at Stuart's and we'll be happy to come back soon
231402,59191632,2016-01-08,33546391,Ian,A first class stay  Stuart was there to welcome us  helped us settle in and gave us a thorough tour of the apartment. After that he was available if needed but left us to ourselves. A great apartment with fantastic views. There was tea  coffee  milk  orange juice  bread  powder for the washing machine and tablets for the dishwasher making our first day much easier.  Good internet and plenty of informative stuff in the apartment. Green Point is a great place to be based for a holiday  supermarkets and plenty of eating places withing walking distance  with the VA Waterfront about fifteen minutes away on foot. We will be back.
231402,60255480,2016-01-21,16124791,Jessica,Stuart's appartment in Green Point was really perfect for our four night stay in the area. The proximity to the V and A Waterfront  grocery stores  etc. made it a wonderful location for exploring the city.  The neat architecture of the multi-leveled loft and the views made this one of our favorite places to stay over our three week trip to Cape Town
231402,62164524,2016-02-12,53695018,Christine,Excellent accommodation in Green Point. Great views  convenient location  really a home away from home. Wifi not very reliable though  and the living room furniture could use an update to something more comfortable. Minor points that in no way marred our wonderful time there. Highly recommend a stay here.
231402,62626244,2016-02-15,56081304,Joel  Jasmin,Great apartment with a fantastic view It's kept in a beautiful wooden style. It is very spacious and is equipped with all you need. Very comfortable bed The only thing we would criticize is that the apartment was not all the way clean floors  fridge Stuart himself was a good host. Green Point is a central area and ideal to explore Cape Town.
231402,71051633,2016-04-23,8307438,Hanna,Great place to stay in Cape Town.  Excatcly as pictured and described on Airbnb listing.
231402,74825361,2016-05-16,51218636,Janice,The Loft was excellent accommodation. We stayed for almost 2 weeks and were very comfortable. Everything we needed was available. It is an easy walk to the Promenade and Waterfront. Stuart was helpful and always available when needed. Thank you very much.
231402,86459475,2016-07-16,70572569,Sameena,This loft apartment is lovely and I had an amazing time there during my visit to Cape Town. Stuart was very kind to leave a bottle of water  orange juice  bread  butter  and coffee. There is a splendid espresso machine that I used daily and a washing machine and hair dryer as well. You are within a short walking distance to plenty of restaurants on Main Street  and not far from the Waterfront. It is a central location with splendid views of Cape Town. It is absolutely glorious to watch the sunrise from the loft window in the morning. There is also a back deck where you can have have breakfast or work during the day. there is also wi fi and cable access TV. On Tuesdays and Thursdays  some one comes to the clean the place as well  and provide fresh towels. I have absolutely no complaints This is sure to be a lovely stay.
231402,90296196,2016-07-31,6546378,Katie,I cannot recommend this spot highly enough  Usually we like to explore new places but if we return to Cape Town we will stay at the Braeside House--it's that amazing  My husband and I kept wondering whether Stuart would let us move in forever haha.  It is in a great location  is beautifully decorated  and there were even some snacks for us when we got there  We LOVED our stay--you won't regret yours

751785,233552391,2018-02-10,43162963,Andac,Location was perfect. Bed was too comfortable. But there is no wifi in the house. We tought that we would have wifi. Also  we didnt have hot water in the shower. If you cant take shower without hot water  it will be too dificult to you. You have only two minutes to take shower so you cant wait water get warmer. Cooking tools were not good  as well. But the other things were okay. You will have good view from the balcony and also will have a cat neighbour. 
751785,707005441190410811,2022-09-02,273238168,Musalula,Jaco is a lovely host. The place is beautiful  with a great view of Table Mountain. However  the check-in process was unpleasant Jaco has engaged a company for this. In addition  there are a few other things that could be better done -- no cleaning  no extra linen  and some appliances are not in good condition  including the stove some plates do work  but there was no memo on this  washing machine  and wifi router.
759767,3361945,2013-01-17,4339873,Glenn,The house is great. Big enough for four people. Nice view of the table mountain And woodbridge island is fantastic. Nice restaurants on the island.
231402,96836404,2016-08-24,15571720,Emma,Our stay at the Braeside House Loft Apartment was fantastic.  The spotlessly clean place had a stunning view  with huge windows and a lovely deck.  There was off street parking  and even a washing machine a huge boon to a family.  The location is extremely convenient - residential  but within easy walking or driving distance of pretty much everything.   Highly recommended
231402,98227842,2016-08-30,14098078,Bridget,Spacious stylish homely place. Appreciated the fresh orange juice and bread for breakfast. Everything provided in the flat that we needed and very comfy beds. Was well situated to walk to the waterfront.
231402,100154397,2016-09-07,37964665,Chloe,The view is amazing and the loft very spaceful. I would highly recommend this place. Stuart was also a very kind host
759767,23301094,2014-11-28,23018035,Christina,The apartment is exactly as described and on picture  functional  comfy n cosy. Save place in a gated community by the beach  great view.  Very close to the city centre10' by car  didn't try the bus  Steven was very nice  we're delayed by 3h due to airplane tech. problems  came out in the dark with heavy rain and of course got lost for an hour girls not needing sat. navs. and he was waiting for us to be able to leave his place  very good natured. The apartment has all the comforts one might need  except a hand shower  which was my only regret - not checking  about that Place is ok clean  not for neat freaks  we had power cuts  with no fault of our host of course  but would've liked to know about it b4 hand  will watch the news next time
759767,26976352,2015-02-23,10049335,Zvika,Steve welcomed us when we arrived and explained in details about the house and the neighborhood.
231402,114351419,2016-11-17,520477,Gernot,Great place to discover Cape Town. Scenic view. Host has to work on his social skills.
231402,115250416,2016-11-23,67467765,Bjrn,Great apartment in a wonderful part of Greenpoint. Fantastic view from the big windows to the Greenpoint stadium and park.
231402,117274964,2016-12-05,22277923,Thomas,Was fr ein Ausblick. Wir hatten eine groe Loft-Wohnung mit einer tollen Aussicht auf das Stadion. Stuart ist sehr nett und hat uns bei der Nutzung der ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel mit den mycity Karten ausgeholfen. Oft haben wir vor den Panoramafenstern gesessen und nur den Ausblick genossen. Es gibt auch ein zustzliches Bett  welches Herabklappbar ist und fr Kinder gut geeignet. In dem kleinen Schlafzimmer sollte man  bedingt durch die Schrgen  aufpassen sich nicht zu stossen. Dafr hat man auch von dort einen herrlichen Ausblick. Es gibt noch einen Kohlegrill von Weber aud der kleinen Terrasse fr die Mglichkeit eines eigenstndigen Braais. Ein kleiner abschliebarer Stauraum fr die Koffer ist auch vorhanden. Green Point ist bekannt fr viele BB Etablissements und Stuarts Loft gehrt sicherlich zu den Besonderen. Ein Sparmarkt ist unten auf dem Main-Street nicht weit entfernt. Auch die VA Waterfront ist fulufig erreichbar. Die Kchenzeile ist gut ausgestattet und offen. Alles in allem ein gelungener Aufenthalt.
231402,122401078,2016-12-23,97635012,Miriam,We had the loft apartment at Braeside House. Stuart was a great host. It was no problem that we arrived earlier because of a changed flight. Everything we could possibly need was there. He even thought of a welcome pack with all essential foods and drinks for the first meal. Braeside is perfectly situated to discover Cape Town and the view over Green Point is great. Surely a place to go back to.
231402,125276380,2017-01-04,21810098,Pam,This apartment has really great views  very comfortable and Stuart is very helpful with local advice. Strongly recommend booking this apartment.
231402,128861138,2017-01-28,5329166,Mathew,An amazing apartment with an average host. We love AirBnB as it allows us to meet different people in different places of the world. Stuart made us feel a bit unwelcome to start with  like we were just a disturbance. Asked where was good to eat nearby he pointed left and right and said anywhere is good. If you aren't concerned about conversing with your host this would be ok. The apartment was clean  tidy  quiet  comfy bed  heaps of space etc etc. But again  we do AirBnB foe the host as well.
231402,167630062,2017-07-07,104097753,Jacqui,This is a truly beautiful place to stay Lovely furnishings  amazing views and a warm atmosphere. We really loved our stay here and will be coming back. The stairs would be difficult for the elderly and with smaller children.
231402,328174243,2018-09-25,10776674,Anne,Comme  la maison en mieux. Le loft est ub endroit fantastique  plus grand que les photos le laissent imaginer  traversant avec terrasse et vue. Prsence discrte et attentionne de Stuart. Quartier tranquille et vivant  la fois  pas trs loin de tout ce quon peut faire au Cap. Deux arrts de bus proche et possibilit de garer sa voiture pour qui en a une... mais le centre-ville est aussi accessible  pied.
231402,412302832,2019-02-15,40873694,Petra,For me the apartment is the best place to stay in Cape Town. It has everything you need for a perfect holiday. Great location and close to restaurants and attractions . And Stuart is always helpful and available when you need help.
231402,738811055,2021-03-14,164398443,Molly,Lovely place. great location.
231402,388147366996798280,2021-06-19,901222,Ben,A very good choice and in the price range in CT an excellent combo of comfort  location and view.

231402,1062897399242480329,2024-01-06,49040586,Drew,This was a great stay. The view from the living room was a particular highlight but this is a really cool and beautiful apartment overall. For us everything was perfect and Stuart was very helpful.
231402,1085393110734877495,2024-02-06,3401930,Kathryn,A charming  spacious self-catering apartment with amazing views over Green Point park and out to sea. The beds are big and comfortable  and the bean-to-cup coffee machine in the kitchen was a very nice surprise. Stuart was a kind and helpful host who always responded very quickly to messages. I would happily stay there again when I return to Cape Town. Highly recommended.
255987,237271970,2018-02-22,174371231,Vaughan,Great place  friendly people handy to town wouldnt hesitate staying again.
255987,238597733,2018-02-26,146480797,Rick,Clean  comfortable  centrally located in a very secure neighbourhood . Host and staff  are very helpful and really friendly. Supervalue for   money.  I could nor recommend more Go for it.
255987,242804256,2018-03-13,128665289,Thomas,Attention tromperie sur la chambre dont il est question.  dfaut d'tre log dans le fameux htel on m'a dirig dans un immeuble reclus situ  2min en voiture sans aucune prestation sous prtexte que j'avais rserv par le biais d'air bnb infrieur au prix pratiqu. Entendez bien que malgr l'annonce poste sur ce site aucun des lments mentionns ne figuraient dans la chambre. quipements rduits au strict minimum  faites l'impasse sur le frigo  bureau chaise bouilloire et heureusement pour moi j'tais seul car je n'ai eu droit qu' un lit une place. Le comble  Interdiction de pntrer dans l'htel et de pouvoir profiter de ses diffrents attraits  piscine  jardin Enfin pour parfaire le ngatif  le petit-djeuner prvu lui aussi dans les prestations ne pouvais plus tre servi  Est il utile de faire le point sur la propret nglige elle aussi et sur la seule fentre donnant sur un mur. Que ne s'autoriserait on pas lorsqu'il s'agit de pauvres clients ayant opt pour une rservation sur airbnb. Ayant demand de m''entretenir avec le gestionnaire avant de partir j'ai eu droit  une personne malhonnte et arrogante adepte du dialogue de sourd. Je n'ai  aucun moment eu le droit de me justifier. Les clefs rendus on m'a prodigieusement mis  la porte. Plus qu'un commentaire je dnonce une arnaque bien rode sur votre site.
255987,248851666,2018-04-01,99174468,Gabriel,Great location  very quite and close to lots of restaurants. Very convenient.
255987,310137374,2018-08-19,107601249,Douglas,Gary and his team are just great. The accommodation is perfect for families as there is a park 50m away which we used. The location is perfect for walking to Shuls  or promenade. I highly recommend and would stay again at Bellevue Manor
255987,323373578,2018-09-15,188970209,Anna,My friends and I stayed here and absolutely loved it The place is very close to Main Street and the ocean. Gary  the owner  is very friendly and helped my friends do laundry and make us all a big breakfast. The wifi and location are amazing. Great place to stay
255987,357401104,2018-12-10,222529667,Radcliff,Value for money for sure

255987,414333466,2019-02-19,230508489,Paul,The guest house is well located with restaurants and the beach very close and the Water front  a short walk along the seafront.

759767,443083155,2019-04-25,121731408,Hortense,This is a lovely home  our host provides flowers and Easter treats. The location is in a safe complex and close to the city and beach. Woodbridge Island is delightful with a decent restaurant in walking distance  with that iconic view of the mountain. We will return again.
759767,457405329,2019-05-24,1300057,Diane,Fantastic location and wonderful views
759767,540825788,2019-10-04,281751590,Anke,We spent a week at Stevens place and it was absolutely perfect. If you have a car  Woodbridge Island is the perfect location. It is a guarded community and we felt very safe. It probably has the nicest beach in Cape Town  with a beautiful view of table mountain. You can get to the City Center in no time  the next supermarket is only a few minutes away and there is restaurants right on the island. Stevens place is located right at the water with a beautiful view and only a couple of minutes from the beach. It had everything you needed and more. Steven was the perfect host. He was very kind  took his time showing us around and we could reach him on WhatsApp anytime. If we ever visit Cape Town again  we would love to stay at Stevens place again.
759767,566393820,2019-11-19,55941260,Lynn,Great location  one can enjoy a walk on the beach and dinner nearby. Nice pool in the complex. Steven was a good host. We had some drainage issues in the bathroom which Steven tried to resolve as quickly as he could. We had a great relaxing time.
759767,722114409,2021-01-05,105223373,Feroz,Great location and kind host
759767,705651439691475577,2022-08-31,191663820,Benjamin David,People who might want to stay on Woodbridge Island might look for the sea-front whatsoever place. My advise Don't do this. Rent yourself at Steve's place. It is a great house with a stunning view over the lagoon  5 minutes walk to one the most beautiful beaches in Cape Town. There is nothing missing in the apartment  Steve is such a great and approachable host and the cat is simply gorgeous - if you see it.  There is no question if I will come back - only when. And it won't be a long time ahead. Thank you Steve for the great time at your place
759767,778109192695114164,2022-12-09,191663820,Benjamin David,I stayed the second time with Steve and it was again an absolute bliss staying there. The house is stunning  super clean in a nice and cozy setting. Steve is a great host  super approachable and I simply had a great time. Woodbridge Island is an absolute gem in the Cape Town region. As I had some hot days There are three pools in walking distance you have access to. Everything is clean and well taken care of. The beach is 5 minutes away and provides the best sunsets in town. Thank you Steve for the great hospitality I will definitely come back
759767,797618960078289227,2023-01-05,23684186,Drever,Steve was a great host and his place is  ideally located. Walk to the beach and have 3 sparkling pools on the island to choose form. Woodbridge island is also only a short drive to Cape Town City centre. We had a great stay.
759767,851985818134860784,2023-03-21,191663820,Benjamin David,It is a stunning place. Steve allowed me to stay for several times now and he is the perfect host. Absolutely uncomplicated  the place is immaculate and just beautiful. Hope to come back soon.
768582,139695054,2017-03-26,118933425,Nadja,Beautiful little flat  we will definitely come back
768582,145817161,2017-04-20,36127182,Caitlin,Our stay in Lizzie's flat was amazing  it is a perfect little spot if you are down for a little holiday. Walking distance to lions head and signal hill as well as restaurants and shops along the main road. Off the road parking which is great. This little get away spot makes you feel like home the moment you walk in. It's exactly what you see in the pictures with a great little industry style kitchen which we fell in love with.Lizzie was an amazing host always willing to help and was fast to answer any of our questions. Should definitely stay here and again and recommend it to anyone.
768582,222231803,2017-12-29,160204448,Shweta,Lizzie's apartment is very modern and chic. We loved staying at her place. The location is perfect for a nice walk on Seapoint promenade and close to a lot of food joints. Lizzie left us a sheet containing all the information we needed to make things easier for us in her apartment. Very thoughtful host and wonderful apartment.
768582,228306441,2018-01-19,44429631,Anna,Lizzie's place was a home from home while we explored the Waterfront in our first few days in Cape Town. Easy to find and access  the apartment is close to the busy Sea Point beachfront.  Lizzie is a travel writer and there are numerous travel guides on the shelf and other interesting books about Africa to give you some background information if you have time for reading.  The place is tastefully decorated with interesting pieces and comfortable furniture.  All appliances worked well and we had everything we needed to eat in or get ready to go out to town.  Plenty of Ubers in the area and shops on Main road.  Would definitely recommend or book again for a return trip.
768582,799062366720010859,2023-01-07,424281891,Mellissa,Lovely place to stay and very spacious and quiet
768582,1122326157544022228,2024-03-28,84398651,Charlotte,It was lovely staying at Lizzie's place. The apartment had everything we needed  it's located in a cool neighbourhood where everything is very walkable. The travel guides Lizzie has gave us a great insight in Cape Town and other places.
771176,3051799,2012-12-09,4135207,Mariet,We had a wonderfull stay with a very hostile family. We can recommend The African Sun as a nice and pleasant BB
771176,3126184,2012-12-20,4318702,Cooper,I couldn't have imagined more welcoming  helpful  accomodating hosts than what I had at African Sun. Don and Patricia are fantastic people  in addition to the fact that the apartment is a wonderful  quiet place from which to base your exploration of the Cape Peninsula. I can't endorse this rental enough.
255987,427760158,2019-03-24,135456515,Janine,Excellent location and Gary was a great host who attended to all our queries.

771176,3207637,2013-01-01,2163884,Tyne,Rich and I really enjoyed our stay at African Sun B and B. Don and his wife are very welcoming  warm and interesting people filled with valuable knowledge about Cape Town and South Africa. The attached private room is very comfortable and clean. It's close to the city centre and quite for a good nights sleep. We used the outdoor shower daily which was a very nice addition to the accommodation.  I know where we will be staying next time we are in Cape Town Thanks again for the great stay

255987,1050633770387014645,2023-12-20,551586352,Manual,Very Clean and Private.  Thanks for everything
255987,1054965075177010842,2023-12-26,76076661,Dylan,This is a great find  ten out of ten would recommend- booked it for family and they absolutely loved their stay. Gary and co are an amazing bunch of people and Gary himself is super friendly and helpful - all in all very happy to have found the spot
255987,1056392376328429369,2023-12-28,394237979,Waldo,Gary was a perfect host. The team went above and beyond to get us settled in and make us feel right at home. 
255987,1062231795275717008,2024-01-05,10802844,Matthew,Had a good time staying at Gary's. He is very friendly and helpful and there is a very cute labrador around who likes tummy rubs. Room was very spacious and nice - and there are lots of nice cafes and restaurants nearby. Would recommend
255987,1091163348141733283,2024-02-14,56351703,Marcie,Original heritage Victorian house with broekie lace and columns. Quirky touches. A warm and relaxed stay - very pleasant. Toasties and ye old tales to come 
255987,1105003445895860518,2024-03-04,351978740,Frankie,Gary and co took my partner and I in very last minute and were incredibly accommodating and helpful. It's really difficult to find a dog friendly airbnb on a whim and at an affordable price so we were really relieved to have stumbled across Bellevue Manor. We ended up wanting to stay an extra night  which they welcomed with open arms and even shuffled other bookings around so that we could stay in the room we had been in. Really homely feeling and super friendly and kind staff. We will definitely be in touch again 
771176,3629320,2013-02-26,675258,Julius,Great unit with big bathroom and kitchen. No problem checking in and they left me a healthy bread  cheese  butter  jam  fresh fruit  coffee  tea and milk for snacks and breakfast. Fast wifi  privacy and secure parking. All I needed and then some. I will definitely return.
771176,3650583,2013-02-27,5106184,Malte,Very nice accommodation The shower outside is beautiful  everything was clean. Thanks a lot
771176,5950469,2013-07-23,48854,Teri,So  what can I say  My trip to Cape Town was fantastic  and the hosts  Don  Patricia  were so wonderful.  First of all  the apartment is much larger than what the pictures show.  The hosts were ever so kind in offering suggestions of where to go and what to see  and even let us extend our trip a couple extra days.  One of the best parts was mountain biking on Table Mountain with Don  But truly  the best part was getting engaged to my boyfriend during my stay in Cape Town.  What a memorable experience

771176,7423043,2013-09-19,8635399,Anne,It's almost a shame that we already had made our plans for the trip  cause Don knows a lot about his country and we could have learn much more listening to him. But at least he has confirmed our choices. Don and Patricia are really welcoming and friendly  the place is perfect  quiet  peaceful and comfortable  with an attention for the details that make it a more than recommandable address. And yes  the outside shower is great
771176,8766008,2013-11-17,9011278,SJ  Roald,We had an extremely positive stay at African Sun. It started with the cheese  bread and bottle of wine that were ready for us at arrival. Don not only gave us great advice on things to do and not do  recommendations on restaurants including helping us with reservations  but also drove us to the supermarket on the first day and waited for us to get some basic things. The apartment is much bigger than the picture shows. All in all we had a great stay and would happily go back if we ever make it back to Cape Town.
275876,2284255,2012-09-14,2634268,Guillaume,Great apartment The space is very nice. The neighborhood is a cool base to explore the Cape.
275876,3822797,2013-03-18,5124872,Amy,Very very nice loft in a great location  Exactly as advertised.  A little noisy since it's close by to a bar so just be aware if you are looking for a quiet spot- will likely be people chattering away until 2-3am when the bars close.  But still- can't beat Kloof St for convenience in terms of getting around it is perfectly located and access to delicious and varied cuisines And the apartment definitely is built to accommodate several people comfortably.
275876,4496314,2013-05-08,5958025,Faith,Martin's place was just as it was pictured and as explained in the other reviews. Conveniently located off of Kloof St  every site we wanted to see was in proximity. The only thing I was turned off by was the fact that the bathroom didn't have a door  but luckily it was just my sister and I so it wasn't that big of a deal. Other than that  Martin was a great host  and although we weren't able to meet  he was very responsive and helpful along the way. I would definitely recommend his place to anyone looking for a central location in Cape Town
275876,18491333,2014-08-27,263321,Kris,We had a great stay in Martin's place that is situated in the up and coming Kloof Street  which is a good 5' walk from the centre and just next to everything you could possibly need. Martin was very responsive and helpful via mail  also during the stay. The rooftop terrace and the view on the table mountain is just amazing. As others mentioned  do bring earplugs  but just perfect apart from this  I slept extremely well. Definitely coming back one day -
275876,19202641,2014-09-08,18392266,Jens,Martin is a wonderful host  bringing his attention and good taste to make this apartment shine. It is very spacious  well equipment  tasteful and a perfect example for modern urban living. It is located in a small street in a very nice and safe neighborhood steps away from cosy or stylish restaurants and little shops and 5 minutes by car to the table mountain. Parking is no problem in the immediate vicinity. The perfect place in the centre of Cape Town to discover the city even by foot for some days or to feel at home during a longer stay. Check-in and check-out is very convenient with his kind maid. We had a wonderful time there.
771176,8978165,2013-11-30,2818096,Wayne,Don and Patchi's place was quite simply the best Airbnb experience I've had to date. It's a spacious little apartment with a awesome outdoor area and a great kitchen. The outdoor shower was amazing Thanks for your hospitality and for organising the braai place - sorry we never got to spend more time with you
771176,9017641,2013-12-02,4366543,Paul,The accomodations were top-notch.  However  it was Don and Patricia's hospitality that truly made African Sun stand out.  They went above and beyond in every way imaginable.  From engaging converstation to excellent recommendations on wineries to visit and trails to hikebike Don even took me out on a mountain bike ride up to Tafelberg Rd  I felt like they took a genuine interest in helping me make the most out of my trip.  They played a big part in making Capetown one of the most enjoyable and memorable traveling experiences I have ever had.
771176,9489555,2013-12-31,2273502,Kendall,Staying at African Sun was great The apartment was larger than I expected and the views of Cape Town splendid. The Waterfront and other attractions are very close by and having my own outside garden with a shower was perfect to lounge around in the hot sunny afternoons. Don was ever so accommodating and I couldn't have asked for anything more. Gem of a place
771176,9770481,2014-01-09,1450899,Bruno,Don is the best host you an wish for. We change our complete travel trip because he was sure it would be better. He was more than right. We loved his tips. Go here The appartment is livery with an outside shower and it's on a perfect spot in Cape Town. Thanks don
771176,10242981,2014-02-09,8404394,Elisabeth,We had a great time et African sun The accommodation was just what we expect  comfy and clean. We especially appreciated to shower in the garden. Don and Patricia are great host and very interesting people too  we enjoyed their company but as we were out discovering the city most of the time during our stay  we haven't been able to spend as much time speaking with them as we would have liked. Shame African sun is near city centre and table mountain  which offers a whole range of things to do while staying there.
771176,11280315,2014-03-28,4397172,David,Don and Patricia were great hosts - very helpful with tips for places to visiteat etc and really interesting people. The flat was very cosy and in a great location - easy to get into the city and lots of superb local restaurants near by.
275876,20650212,2014-10-03,11135892,Francis,Wonderful location  great apartment  and really easy to work with Martin. Would stay here again in a heartbeat
275876,20903812,2014-10-07,15980065,Sarah,Our stay at Kloof St Cottage was perfect. Great location in Gardens  right in the heart of Kloof st  a safe clean and spacious home with great views of table mountain from the deck. Martin made every effort to make our stay seamless. We definately recommend this place
275876,21702657,2014-10-22,8162941,Helmar,Wonderful  well located location with great views of table mountain and lions head. Martin is a great host. An explict recommendation.
275876,21898908,2014-10-26,6084420,Jenny,Terrific place to stay. Even though Martin our host was out of the country he was very responsive and arrangements were all super organised. The apartment is fabulous and is in a wonderful location. Thoroughly recommended.
275876,22581967,2014-11-10,20944313,Ralf,Great accomodation in a nice surrounding. Place for 41 guests. well equipped and with Wlan. A great view from the roofdeck. Martin is very helpful and answers quick on all mails. Some things could be improofed  so as we missed a coffeemaker and a little board next to the bed to lay down the phone or the alarmclock during the night. A sunumbrellar on the roof wold also be helpful. But anyway  we had a very nice stay in this house. Thanks to Martin and Emarie  the maid.
275876,22839431,2014-11-16,2041036,Floortje,We had a great stay in the wonderful apartment of Martin. The apartment is just like the pictures. We felt at home immediately. Our  little son loved the swing and the roofterrace has beautiful views over the Table Mountain and Lions Head. The apartment is very close to all kinds of nice bars  restaurants and shops.  We would absolutely recommend this place for a great stay in Capetown.
771176,11912663,2014-04-19,11103944,Lorm,We loved our stay here. Large  comfortable room in a great location. The area is safe to walk around in  and the local restaurants are a blessing when you don't feel up to cooking. Don  Patricia are wonderful hosts - Don even provided us with a jump start when we stupidly left our rental car lights on overnight.  Highly recommend this place.
771176,12075424,2014-04-22,271663,Zainab,Don was a fantastic host African Sun was in a great location. The guest house was BEAUTIFUL and we were greeted with welcome goodies of bread  cheese  cookies  and a bottle of wine It was so lovely. Don also let us know about the local farmer's market the next morning and we were thrilled to buy some local goods and have breakfast before our trip to Robben Island. We spent 3 days running in and out and all around Capetown and rested very well at African Sun. I plan on coming back to Capetown and I will most definitely stay at African Sun again when I do. I also plan on sending friends there when they visit. My only regret is that we did not get to spend much time with Don and his wife. I would have liked to learn more about them as I think they have some great stories to tell
771176,12222810,2014-04-26,4764018,Jacob,Don and Patricia were very hospitable  and gave us all kinds of advice on how to enjoy capetown. The space was beautiful  and has an amazing patio with outdoor shower. Highly recommended
771176,12968796,2014-05-16,3164128,Justyna,We had a lovely stay at African Sun. The place is beautiful and cozy and the hosts are wonderful people. The area is save and can be reached by MyCiti bus. Thanks to Don' advice we spent also a fantastic night on a farm near Kalitzdorp. Thank you for everything We know where we will stay the next time we visit Cape Town
771176,14198223,2014-06-14,10307577,Niklas,African Sun is a magnificent accommodation. It was the first stay of our trip through the Western Cape region and it proved as perfect to explore Cape Town. Everything about the accommodation was designed with great attention to detail  ensuring an uncomplicated and pleasant stay. We enjoyed the intimacy of our rooms and loved Don and Patricia's hospitality.
771176,14417229,2014-06-18,13412328,Greg  Mandy,Don  Patricia greeted us with a bottle of wine  fruit amd bunch of other things. The BB is a nice setup.  Will stay again.
771176,15035476,2014-07-01,11363701,Kristina  Andy,We had a lovely time in Cape Town and African Sun was just what we expected calm  friendly and a very nice place to be based in the city.
771176,15171465,2014-07-04,13795298,Gordon,We much enjoyed our stay here Don and Patricia are considerate - and interesting - hosts  the house is great  and the neighborhood is close to much of the central part of the city. We'll happily stay here again
771176,15323538,2014-07-07,15730329,Nathan,Don and Patricia were extremely helpful and gracious hosts for a few nights at the beginning of our first visit to southern Africa. The accommodations were outstanding for a very reasonable price  and we were amazed at the very affordable gourmet quality meals available just a few blocks away. The winter weather was mostly terrible  but a cozy room to return to and fascinating hosts to converse with went a long way towards making our Cape Town experience a fond memory We would definitely stay here again in the future.
771176,15619741,2014-07-13,13566409,Steve,African Sun exceeded our expectations.  My son and I had the good fortune to select Don and Patricia's charming home.  The neighborhood is beautiful and set at the base of Table Mountain.  The area is Vredhoek and boasts excellent restaurants minutes away from the bnb.  Walking down to Long Street in the hub of Cape Town is very doable  however the trek back is all up hill and one might consider a short taxi ride back.  The hosts at African Sun are gracious and witty.  Both are authors and have experienced life to its fullest.  Conversations with them are inspiring and fascinating to say the least.  I would highly recommend this listing and can't wait for the opportunity to visit African Sun again in the not too distant future.
275876,27254970,2015-03-01,509429,Catherine,Great space and amazing location. I would highly recommend it
275876,40766287,2015-08-02,6515318,Celia,We had a great stay at Martin's apartment just off Kloof St. The apartment was clean  tidy  exactly as described. While Martin was en route to Brasil we were welcomed by Yolandi  Martin was contactable at any time. Location was perfect  close to great cafes  restaurants. While it was winter the upstairs deck was beautifully warming in the afternoon sun. The perfect Cape Town location
771176,16884635,2014-08-04,13415293,Sunni,What is the maximum number of stars I can give this accommodation I give it that. My husband and I were very happy here - comfortable  warm  fantastically-located  visually-delighted by both the apartment and the scenery and  to put the cherry on top  the pricing was fair and reasonable. We signed on for two weeks originally and added a third because it was so fantastic. If you are headed to Cape Town  don't think twice about African Sun. We were lucky to have found it.
771176,18167990,2014-08-23,15917136,Jill,I had a Nice welcome in African Sun  with smiles  food  a bottle of good South African wine  presence and attention. The appartment is a part of Don and Patricia's house  but you can easily create your privacy thanks to a door which communicates between your area and their. If you feel like talking  asking questions  you just have to tell it  by opening this door  there is always somebody to help you. Also the appartment is well decorated  confortable  clean  with its own front door  its own patio  perfect to eat  chill  take an outside shower  in the most quiet neighborhood in Cape Town. There is also room for your car if you have one. Which is recommnded to me. As I highly recommand to go at Don and Patricia's
771176,19709587,2014-09-16,241955,Kelly,Don and Pat's place is charming  and Don was very friendly and helpful. The location is superb if you're looking for a quiet getaway. The neighborhood has presents strikingly close views of Table Mountain  and we were able to walk to the Plattekiep sp Gorge trail. This apartment doesn't have a living room  but the lovely patio  wine and snacks made up for it.
771176,20001508,2014-09-22,8540650,Virginia,This was a fabulous stay We were welcomed with wine and enough staples to help us though our stay
771176,20371520,2014-09-28,13246365,Karen,We had a lovely stay at African Sun. Don and Patricia were very welcoming and friendly to us and our young children. The beds were comfortable  and the dcor attractive  warm and homely  with some beautiful photos and fabrics. The bottle of excellent wine  cheese  bread and fruit were a lovely touch and were much enjoyed. We had our privacy  but our hosts were very helpful when needed. The outdoor shower is great The neighbour's cat in the picture is very friendly and was a hit with our children. We can highly recommend this as a lovely place to stay. Thank you to our hosts.
771176,21060528,2014-10-10,7968306,Bart,Don and patricia's place was great. We enjoyed it a lot. It really feels like a cosy and homelike place. Also Don gave us plenty of tips for the rest of the road. The neighborhood is safe and you can park your car behind the fence. Even though their place is near the city centre  table mountain  and other attractions  the best way to get there is by having a car.
771176,21375686,2014-10-16,13826535,Ciaran  Niamh,Had a wonderful stay with Don and Patricia. They were generous with great advice and local knowledge  which is one of the great benefits of staying Airbnb. The apartment was spotless and had everything we needed  parking was easy and the location was great for getting to Cape Town. Highly recommended
771176,22072066,2014-10-29,13415293,Sunni,This was actually my 2nd stay at African Sun  largely because the first time it was so wonderful. This is now my official haven in Cape Town - the hosts are amazing  the place has every need taken care of  and the price can't be beat. Highly recommended.
771176,22752440,2014-11-13,21767715,Tricia,African Sun is a lovely little place to stay in Cape Town.  I was only able to have a brief stay  but it was very comfortable and Don  Patricia were very good hosts  welcoming me with a few nibbles and a fantastic booklet of info about the area.  My only regret was it was bit too chilly for me to try the outdoor shower
771176,23238126,2014-11-26,3628734,Sven,Was made to feel most welcome by my friendly hosts - Don is a nature photographer and theres a few lovely examples of his work hanging in the apartment...its a lovely haven....and feels quite private  Love the outside shower.....was able to bring my car inside and it all felt very secure.....beautiful glimpses of the mountain and table bay from the back patio area. Highly recommended.
771176,24070325,2014-12-19,16328575,Judy,In spite of the fact that our flight from the UK meant that we arrived at midnight  we were given a wonderfully warm welcome and an amazingly generous welcome tray.
771176,24910510,2015-01-04,17633694,Maartje,We had a great time at African Sun Don and Patricia made us feel very welcome and were really helpful with planning our activities around Cape Town. The apartment is very cosy and convenient. The neighbourhood is lovely too  close to town and it has some nice coffee places and restaurants. The outdoor area is great for barbecues. We would definitely stay here again
771176,26240590,2015-02-08,2626844,Andrea,Tolle unterkunft an ruhiger lage  sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites paar. Unterkunft genauso schoen wie auf webside. Herzlichen dank und bis zum naechsten mal  andreachristoph
771176,27756007,2015-03-11,11721838,Amber,Don was a very welcoming host and waited for us when we arrived late. The house has everything you need and in a perfect quiet area and a lot to do in walking distance. Would really recommend
771176,28266139,2015-03-21,28273993,Nikolaj,Excellent stay Don and Patricia's house is a lovely place - An authenic african vibe in Cape Town. Wish we could have stayed much longer We had a warm welcoming with nice cheese and wine - just what you need when exploring Cape Town The hosts are inspiring and joyful people. Best recommendations.
771176,28778188,2015-03-30,5826900,Benjamin,Don and Patricia were extremely welcoming hosts with a charming home in one of Cape Town's most beautiful neighborhoods. Their guest apartment was perfect for our short stay in the city  though we certainly would have been comfortable staying there for longer. Don welcomed us with great wine and snacks and a very useful guide that he created to help guests take advantage of the city. We would happily stay with Don and Patricia during our next visit and would definitely recommend their place to other couples staying overnight in Cape Town.

771176,34638212,2015-06-10,2553623,Nikola,African Sun is a welcoming  comfortable and ideally located accommodation. The hosts are interesting  smart people and if you're lucky you might even get to browse some of their books or view their magical elephant photos. You get your own bathroom  kitchen  entrance and outside porch and are right at the bottom of Table Mountain and only about 30mins walk to the centre of town. Everything about this bb was just great.
771176,36742948,2015-06-30,6977444,Andrew,So so fantastic  Don and Patchy made me feel so incredibly welcome.  Thank you  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  I give you ten stars out of five
275876,42352754,2015-08-12,35878002,Jessica,Martin was kind of him to host for 5 nights at his house in Cape Town.  We really loved his roof deck and decor.  The location in Gardens was convenient and safe.  He was also super helpful in communicating with us throughout our stay.  If we're back in Cape Town  we hope to visit again
275876,43398662,2015-08-19,25549198,Ulrike,We had such a wonderfull stay at Martins Apartment  wich is very very nice  clean  with beautiful sight from the terasse. Thanks for the warm welcome. We enjoyed the good shopping possibilities  the bars and Restaurants around .. It was more than wie expected.
275876,45086747,2015-08-31,5700810,Alexander,Martin's place was awesome and exactly as described in the posting photos. The location cant be beat  and the deck was amazing.  Martin was easy to communicate with and all the logistics went quite smoothly. couldn't ask for more.
275876,45795436,2015-09-06,3415791,Edwin,Martin was a wonderful host. He provided us with local wisdom and recommended a few of his favorite spots in Cape Town i.e. First Thursday's and Woodstock Exchange. The location of the house was perfect. Plenty of hip cafe's along Kloof street and a quick 10-15 minute walk to Bree street where you'll find some great restaurants. Table Mountain  Lion Head  and Camps Bay are a 5-10 minute drive from the house and you can get a killer view of Table Mountain from the rooftop balcony of the house. There's a grocery store across the street and a liquor store next door in case you want to use the kitchen  which came in handy. Checking inout was a breeze and Martin was very responsive throughout the trip. We had a great time  wish we could have stayed longer.
275876,50016321,2015-10-08,31833162,Kyle,What a incredible place to stay while in Cape Town. The location is ideal to get a feel for down town  situated in a trendy an vibe part of kloof street. It is also close to table mountain and lions head. The apartment itself is simple but beautifully done with refurbished wood. The decked roof top is ideal for hosting friends. On the whole highly recommended.
275876,50776896,2015-10-14,25627392,Aleya,Stayed here with a friend and we absolutely loved it. The apartment was sleek and stylish  comfy  and in a great location. You're just blocks away from various shops  bars  and restaurants. Not to mention the epic view of table mountain from the patio. I highly recommend this place  and will definitely be back sometime soon...
275876,53266337,2015-11-07,43614933,Karina,Very nice and stylish apartment in one of the most vibrant parts of Cape Town. Definitely a place to come back
275876,54335246,2015-11-18,21040934,Alexander,A spacious apartment in a great area - if you want to be around Kloof street then this is a very good place to be. A bit of wear and tear to the apartment but only small things. Although a braai on the terrace would have been a plus.
275876,54464289,2015-11-20,42030061,Andrew,Martin's apartment is amazing. In a perfect location  right off Kloof St.  it's a stone's throw from some of the best restaurants and bars in the city. The roof deckpatio was also the perfect place to wind down the day  bottle of wine in hand. All in all  a great apartment and experience
275876,55891374,2015-12-07,41026501,Eugene,Martin's communication was excellent and he responded almost immediately. The housekeeper Yolandi was a joy and made  us feel very welcome. The cottage location is good for restaurants and bars however tends to be a bit noisy because of the close proximity to said bars.
275876,56459793,2015-12-13,45194250,Peter,Great place and great location  very central to Cape Town's hustle and bustle. Martin responded very quickly and Yolandi welcomed us on our arrival. Would definitely stay again  thanks
275876,59202232,2016-01-08,20413361,Kiku  Dan,We stayed for a week and the place was fantastic. Beautiful home and location. Highly recommended.
275876,60328025,2016-01-22,25226192,Tobias,Great cosy house in urban center of tamblerskloof. Nearby to the best Cafs and Reataurants ...we enjoyed our stay very much. For a longer stay we were missing some usual stuff in a appartment like coffee maker  washing machine or air dryer but it was fun to stay though. Martin was very nice and always answered right away to our mails.
275876,62364893,2016-02-14,53624433,Miriam,Martin is a very helpful and nice host. I must outline Martins recommendations for food  which were very good  The apartment is also in a lovely area in cape town. The terrace is very nice as well. We arranged everything with Yolandi  the helpful and uncomplicated housekeeper  who sometimes was hard to reach  but everything turned out well. One negative aspect The missing air-con  since the apartment gets really hot during the day.
275876,62981270,2016-02-19,25743273,Daniel,We loved staying at Martin's place The area is our favorite area in CPT with all its restaurants  cafs  galleries and cool spots The apartment itself is as beautiful as on the photos  we loved the interior design. A special  thanks for Martin with being very nice and helpful and always answering in a few minutes and to his maid Yolandi who is just soooo nice and sweet. Everything was just perfect 5 Stars
275876,64085306,2016-02-29,11086917,Sara,We were met by the wonderful Yolandi and were absolutely delighted with our stay in Martin's cottage. The location couldn't have been better and the cottage was great. We especially loved sitting on the deck. Martin was completely responsive in the lead up to our stay and I would recommend his place without hesitation.
275876,67132898,2016-03-27,3072646,Michael,Thank you for a fantastic stay. Martin's place is exactly as described  and the location is excellent.
275876,68401516,2016-04-04,3787381,Jagdish Kumar,The neighbourhood is great It is very close to the places of interest like Table mountain  Waterfront etc. Unfortunately we could not meet Martin. Hence the personal touch was missing.
275876,69470566,2016-04-11,36889016,Matthias,Great place in Cape Town  great location in a hip neighborhood  excellent coffee and service at vovo telo and delicious food at black sheep
275876,70226456,2016-04-17,3546958,Betti,Martins place is nice. However our expectations were not fully met. The kitchen is not very well equipped and beds were rather uncomfortable. Getting the keys was also complicated and communication with his maid was awful. Cleanliness was also not the best. Again had the communication with the maid been better I'm sure things could have been fixed...
275876,71519060,2016-04-25,3327423,Tom,Martin's place was more than perfect. Beautiful house and walking distance from all the best bars and restaurants. His housekeeper is just the sweetest person - couldn't recommend enough.
275876,73089652,2016-05-06,3817140,Brooklyn,We really enjoyed staying at Martin's place.  What a gorgeous apartment. The pictures on the web  although they capture the key details  do not do the apartment justice.  We were literally blown away by how cool the place was and how much we enjoyed the different spaces around the flat.  The view on the patio is amazing and we spent a lot of time out there.  Both beds were really comfortable as well.  The neighborhood is very well located for dining out and shopping  and we were lucky enough to catch First Thursdays when the galleries stay open until late and serve drinks alongside- don't miss it if you are in town in tandem.
275876,77042282,2016-05-30,30909120,Mickael,Amazing place  very well located and with a fantastic view. I did not meet Martin as he was away but e-mail contact went perfectly well. His maid Yolandi is adorable. Thanks for everything 
275876,123606770,2016-12-30,5267844,Desmond,Great apartment in the center of a neighborhood with great restaurants and shops. Cool place with great feel. Martin was very accommodating about our special needs for arrival and departure and went out of his way to ensure our needs were met. Highly recommended  and we hope to stay again
275876,126111160,2017-01-09,89796183,Michelle,Lovely little place right in the hustle and bustle of Kloof Str. Lots of night life  restaurants  coffee shops  etc. Central to everywhere. Close to town for first Thursdays
275876,149457582,2017-05-04,14743929,Tariq,Martin was a great host  very communicative and helpful with our stay. The location was great and I would highly recommend this listing
771176,44688733,2015-08-28,40791274,Courtney,I had such a lovely visit in the African Sun. Don and Patricia were awesome hosts and the apartment was very comfortable  conveniently located  and well-equipped. Would recommend to anyone. Outdoor shower was amazing
771176,46718220,2015-09-13,37817364,Amy,Do believe the hype.  African sun is a fantastic place to stay whilst exploring Cape Town  with welcoming  friendly  knowledgeable...... Im running out of positive adjectives....helpful and interesting hosts
771176,51700099,2015-10-24,38954329,Jessica,Don welcomed us with warm hospitality  fresh bagels  and a wonderful home for our 3 days in Cape Town. The neighborhood was great and there were restaurants and a place to  get groceries within walking distance. Don and his family had wonderful suggestions for things to do and places to eat in the city and surrounding areas. We are looking forward to our next visit to Cape Town.
771176,53755448,2015-11-12,40660804,Kerry,Don and Patricia were very friendly and happy to help with anything.  Don showed us his local farmers market on saturday.  When we arrived there was wine and nibbles for us. The flat was very clean and tidy and very handy to restaurants  table mountain and central city.   Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
771176,54707131,2015-11-23,8054831,Adam,Don and his wife were great and very accommodating. We were greeted by fresh bagels  cheese and a bottle of wine. The apartment is very comfortable with a very unique outdoor shower don't shy away  it's amazing. Nearby there are several fantastic restaurants and the apartment comes with an excellent information package about Cape Town and their favorite places. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone visiting Cape Town.
771176,54990663,2015-11-27,45837666,Marcin,We could not imagine better place to stay in Cape Town Don and Patricia are extremely kind  hospitable and helpful hosts. The apartment is really beautiful  clean and comfortable. We were welcomed with a bottle o wine  freshly baked bread and cookies. The location of the house is also very convenient - the neighbourhood is quiet and safe  but at the same time close to good restaurants  cafes and a shop - all within walking distance. Thank you both for hosting us - it was a great experience and we really hope to visit you again one day
275876,150972134,2017-05-10,112295029,Myriam,I had a fantastic time. The flat has character  beautiful hard wood furniture  a comfortable double bed and interesting paintings.
275876,155940022,2017-05-29,130808740,Alex,Martin's place was awesome. Great location  walking distance to all the best restaurantsnightlife on Kloof st. Place was very nice on the inside and Martin was a great host. 100 percent recommend
275876,159619370,2017-06-11,23338710,Shelby,Martin's place was so cute and perfect for my friend and I A great kitchen island   cozy bedrooms  hot shower  and the upstairs bedroom is flooded with morning sunlight. The deck has beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. It was cold and rainy during our trip so we didn't walk around near the apartment too much  but getting an Uber there was a breeze. I'd love to stay at Martin's place again
275876,165948289,2017-07-02,31531759,Tina,Matin's apartment is incredible if you want to be in a neighborhood near bars and restaurants  We truly felt like we were experiencing life like a local  Martin is super easy to communicate with and gives excellent reccomendations as well  The rooftop has stunnig views  The only drawback the one very small bathroom which was not ideal because we had 5 people in our group.  Otherwise  this apartment is pretty perfect  Martin just needs to get a blow dryer for the unit    We will definitely stay here again during our next trip to Cape Town
275876,172519660,2017-07-21,4291088,Nco,Kloof Street Dream Loved Martin's Place. The location was great for a first time visit to Cape Town  as a lot of interesting areas to visit were in waking distance. Waterfront  Table Mountain and Camps Bay were also just a short and cheap taxi ride away. Martin's maid Yolandi was also a ROCK STAR. Was so helpful in helping me check in late  as my flight from Paris was delayed 3 hours. But no worry  she helped me with a smooth check in. Comunication was easy with Martin as well  and I really didn't have any issues during my stay. It's a great place to come home to after a long day of sight seeing. It is also a great place to start the night off  with rooftop drinks before hitting the hottest spots in Cape town on Kloof and Bree street. Highly recommend and can't wait to come back
275876,174869243,2017-07-27,64849987,Jai,Comfortable and close to everything.
275876,181207517,2017-08-12,84608187,Keisha,The property itself is quirky and rustic. Excellent location. Close to everything. Great view of the mountains from the balcony. Bed was small for our needs my partner is 6ft5 so the double bed wasn't ideal. We used our stay in Cape Town as 'down time' on our travels around Africa  I say this only to express that our review is purely based on how the property met our needs  intentions for the time spent there. It's with this in mind that the stay was Ok  not great  due to the never ending construction taking place at the hotel directly to the right of the property. So unless you're up and out the door by 7 sightseeing all day  expect a lot of hammering  shouting  and constant banging all day. Martin was excellent in his communication and as he's abroad was unaware of the construction taking place. Again  just for our personal intentions of getting some RR  we didn't find the early morning construction noise a welcome experience. Yolandi is as the reviews say  really lovely. A couple of our messages went unanswered but overall she was lovely. The Property could really use a bath mat as getting up out of the sunken shower when the waters not contained properly could be slippery and hazardous at timesagain just a suggestion. We loved Cape Town and this property really is in a fantastic location. We felt relatively safe. Anyone considering the property for the coming weeks or months should remember there is a lot of construction going on and it doesn't stop except for Sunday's. Lastly if you're visiting in winter  rug up as the property is lofty and can be very chilly  but there are 2 little heaters to take the edge off. Overall a lovely home just a couple things for us personally that didn't leave us itching to get back. Thank you Martin for opening your home to us and for your quick replies our messages.
275876,192238820,2017-09-10,21735508,Tracey,Lovely spot  great location Thanks Martin for being so responsive too

275876,234809601,2018-02-14,15698902,Belinda,This place was beautiful and Martin was a great host. The only downside was  it was a very hot couple of days whilst we were there and with there being no air-con we suffered a little. It was a great location around the corner from great restaurants and would recommend this place.
275876,238150012,2018-02-25,12717348,Nico,Martin's communication is swift and efficient Martin and Yolandi went the extra mile in accommodating our request for storing our luggage after checkout time.

771176,59198862,2016-01-08,45743274,Vera,We had a really comfortable and relaxed stay with Don in Cape Town. He was more than helpful in the beginning  showed us around and recommended his favorite place for dinner  where we almost felt like locals on our first evening
771176,62057159,2016-02-11,42045413,Michael,We were warmly welcomed by Don from the moment we made our reservation.  He provided us with helpful information through emails before we left home.  Don saved us a taxi by picking us up at the hotel where our tour had ended.  The apartment was well furnished in all aspects.  Our home was located near the foot of Table mountain and the view was spectacular.  We were in a great neighborhood and we felt safe walking at any time of the day.  There were several very good restaurants within walking distance  as well as a laundry  grocery store  ATM  and bus stop.  The MyCiti Bus system is well run and inexpensive.  We rented a car for one week and Don provided us with an off-street parking spot.  We were welcomed with wine  cheese  and bread  as well as coffee  biscuits and oranges  Don and Patricia are both authors and they shared several of their books as well as an invaluable tour guide they wrote  complete with maps and suggestions for explorations in the neighborhood  in Cape Town  and farther afield.  It became our bible for the 2 weeks we were their guests.  Both Don and Patricia are very friendly and willing to chat - sharing their experiences and offering helpful advice.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the African Sun
771176,63549452,2016-02-24,22126832,Elisabeth,Ett mycket trevligt och fint boende i centrala Kapstaden. Lugnt omrde precis vid foten av Taffelberget. Ett varmt vlkomnande av Don och hans fru gjorde vistelsen till en synnerligen behaglig upplevelse. Kan verkligen rekommenderas.

275876,243460256,2018-03-16,137688789,Jonathan,Eine Super schicke und tolle Unterkunft. Einziges Manko war die rudimentre Kchenausstattung. Unsere Maid war ein echter Sonnenschein. In der Nachbarstrasse gibt es einen bewachten Parkplatz und die Lage ist einfach perfekt. Zum Frhstcken knnen wir das Caf Paradiso empfehlen bester Cappuccino in der ganzen Stadt.

We loved the flat  especially the rooftop where you can enjoy the view at lions head and cable mountain and making a bbq.

Parkieren kann man gut in einer Nebenstrasse  jedoch sind Geschfte und Restaurants gut und sicher zu Fuss zu erreichen. Die Kommunikation mit Martin verlief perfekt  vor Ort hatten wir mit Ralph und Yolandi 2 freundliche Ansprechpersonen. Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit.

Location was perfect  walking distance to nightlife  shops and not too far from tourist attractions. The home is lovely  cozy and has everything we needed. We had a great time grilling and having nice dinner and drinks on the deck over looking the city. We miss this place and would love to stay here again when we get a chance to come back to Cape Town. Thank you.

Spoilt for choice whether youre looking for a spot for brekky  some vegan lunch  somewhere to get a massage  somewhere to party... And then Martin  even though he was in another time zone at the time of our stay  is on hand to sort out any dramas  should any arise Only downfall  Ill say that the place is basic in terms of amenities. I

Yolandi was very responsive by phone and waited at the apartment for me as my plane was delayed. very loft style  spacious  good shower  well supplied.

We felt safe and secure throughout our stay and really enjoyed the roof deck- perfect for an evening braai. Communication with Martin was also super easy We will certainly come back for another stay
275876,355869788,2018-12-06,218594661,Daniel,Super Lage  die Fotos sind allerdings einige Jahre alt. Insbesondere die Dachterrasse ist komplett verwittert und kaum noch angenehm nutzbar. Der Grill war defekt  eine Reparatur wurde versprochen  jedoch nicht durchgefhrt.
771176,74182276,2016-05-13,56662167,Nikola,What a lovely place Don and Patricia were such kind and friendly hosts We were welcomed with some delicious wine  cheese and bread The space is beautiful and clean and the beds are so comfy The outside stoep area is a lovely place to sit and relax. Own entry that is secure is wonderful.  The bathroom is lovely and spacious and lovely towels  Overall an amazing stay while in Cape Town.
771176,78605600,2016-06-07,55808870,Juliana,Don and African Sun were a great find for us on our trip Great location  close to shops  hiking  and easily found attractions. Accommodations were comfortable  with adequate space for us and our bags  as well as room to expand and relax outdoors if desired. Don's expertise of the area and of travel suggestions was a great plus  especially being in an area with such potential such as Cape Town. He helped us navigate a nearby hike and provided maps and other tips.
771176,99067888,2016-09-03,86026219,Aurore,Great experience at African Sun  the house was lovely  clean  convenient and with a lot of character. The neighborhood is very nice too  safe and with restaurants  shops and coffee places within walking distance and beautiful views of the mountains. Don and his wife are really good hosts  we had very interesting discussions together and they made us feel very welcome.
771176,102025334,2016-09-16,4735088,Georgie,We had a great stay at African Sun. Everything was as described and information provided was really helpful. Very safe area with lots of good food options closeby. Thank you for a great week
771176,104908526,2016-09-29,76025924,Linda,I had a very comfortable stay here Welcoming hosts and very homey unit. Great location with easy access to public transport for exploring the city. My only regret is that it was too cold to try out the outdoor shower 
771176,106789746,2016-10-08,1562413,Vojta,It was a great experience to stay at Don's place. We felt welcome from the very moment we stepped into the house. Their neighbourhood is very nice and quite  although very close to city centre. Even the waterfront is just a short ride away. We had some questions about Cape Town and the surroundings and Don us always provided with detailed and knowledgeable answer. Thanks to Don and his wife our stay in Cape Town was even better than I expected
771176,107764982,2016-10-12,29299283,Andrew,Don's place is perfect. It is a lot bigger than the photos suggest. Very comfortable and cosy. It was easy to drive to anywhere. Don has a lot of interesting stories  photographs and books as well as a lot of knowledge about the area. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend here to everyone.
771176,112852396,2016-11-08,43878852,Verena Margrit Vreni,Don ist ein ganz toller Gastgeber aufmerksam  spannend  vielwissend  sensibel  unterhaltsam kommunikativ. Wir wurden herzlich aufgenommen. African Sun liegt in der Nhe der Busstation  so waren wir auch ohne Auto mobil. Wir fhlten uns in der Nachbarschaft sehr sicher. Wir kommen wieder
771176,115017007,2016-11-21,2905222,Simon,We really enjoyed our stay at Don's place in Cape Town. He and his wife made us feel welcome from day one. Lovely property. As everyone seems to mention in their reviews  the photos do make it look smaller than it really is Oh  and the outside hot shower is fantastic.
771176,117177179,2016-12-05,96847672,Megan,We were made to feel wonderfully welcome The African Sun pamphlet that they left for us was incredibly informative and helpful.  It is a great location and the outside shower was a big plus.
771176,120502883,2016-12-10,29212917,Charlotte,From the moment we arrived  we felt very welcome and were impressed by the room Don  Patricia showed us. It was a lot bigger than we expected and the terrace with its outside shower was amazing We were very lucky that we could stay here. The hosts are such nice and warm people. Don't hesitate to book here
771176,121091334,2016-12-14,4486779,Sharon,A lovely place with the most wonderful outdoor shower  which was perfect to come home to on a hot summer day. Of course  there are great indoor bathing facilities too in a spacious  bathroom. I just opted not to use them. Patricia and Don are gracious and interesting hosts. They have a wealth of knowledge about Cape Town and share it willingly. The bottle of wine waiting for me and the plant-filled patio to drink it on were a good beginning to my stay. The cheese  fruit  muffins and bagels were more than I could eat. Both the apartment and the patio are filled with African art and textiles. The bus stop is right around the corner if you rather not walk to the City Center. A great place to stay in a great city.
275876,367120901,2019-01-04,6803960,Pauliina,The apartment is great  spacious and trendy and location in vibrant neighbourhood is great.

There is a lovely deck off the main bedroom where one has a slice of a view between buildings  of Table Mountain  and also a view of Signal Hill. The cottage has creative use of space and is well laid out and decorated.  We loved the swing chair in the lounge The little cobbled lane it is in is quaint. Parking is in a nearby street. We enjoyed our short stay there.
275876,417404026,2019-02-27,65113343,Clotilde,Stylish and very well located flat near trendy Kloof Street  we absolutely loved the area. The place is quite dark but it has a very nice terrasse with view on Lions Head  shame the BBQ was not working. Martin was very hepful and was flexible with the check out times  which was great as our flight was late. Thanks again
275876,421925301,2019-03-10,48197617,Emilie,The apartment has a PERFECT location  which made our stay so much easier  when going out and exploring the city.

275876,436124820,2019-04-12,104791939,Cameron,I would recommend this home for any young travelers. Conveniently situated. Definitely had time a great time. The cleaning fee is a bit steep but definitely worth it.
275876,438683103,2019-04-17,27459216,Lucy,Lovely apartment on Kloof Street  really near brilliant bars and restaurants. The hosts were kind and communicative. The space was great  with a rooftop to have drinks  stare at the wonderful Table Mountain.

771176,122362826,2016-12-23,71240084,Yusuf,Don and Patricia could not have been better hosts - the most friendly and charming people. The unit has a separate entrance and quite private. Vredehoek is a relaxed part on the outskirts of Cape Town CBD. The beds quite comfortable and more than enough space for myself as a single person - with the outside garden area with outdoor shower as as an added bonus.
771176,125663057,2017-01-06,24051429,Mel,Welcomed on arrival  with lovely bottle of wine and snacks in the kitchen. Quick tour around the neighbourhood to locate local shops etc - conveniently located to just about everything. Hosts very available and helpful throughout stay. Quiet and charming patio area ate breakfast outside every day looking through the trees at a glimpse of Table Mountain. Awesome outdoor shower. Lodging cleaned and tidied for us a few times we were there for a couple of weeks  including change of sheetstowels.
771176,126752366,2017-01-14,14532897,Julia,Don and Patricia's place is a lovely place from which to explore Cape Town  with public transport neabry if  like us  you have to rely on it  a lovely selection of coffee shops  bars and restaurants close  as well as that lovely scenery of Table Mountain just behind. The bedroom has a great size  and that there is a separate kitchen  bathroom  outside shower  and garden to use was simply perfect. Just for that we would definitely stay again - however Don and Patricia are also amazing  welcoming hosts who are easy to approach  happy to help and chat - which is exactly what one wants from an Airbnb experience  They also prepared this great little booklet pointing out things to to and places to go in the vicinity - we loved that We can only recommend staying at African Sun.
771176,130179522,2017-02-04,32713586,Linda,Don and Patricia's place is as pictured - warm  inviting and spacious.  Don went out his way to answer questions and direct us to places of interest.  Their place was  clean  comfortable and had everything we needed.

282586,239108862,2018-02-28,25237254,Celia,The photos already made Cottage de la mer look wonderful. Many places show good photos but when you get there it is not quite how the photos looked. Cottage de la mer was exactly as it looked - if not better. Absolutely perfect for a couple. One large room with bed  sofa  table and 2 chairs plus a kitchen extremely well equipped for a small kitchen - not that we used it much as there are too many good restaurants in Cape Town and bathroom  outside space with plenty of different seating and lovely views. Lovely area too.Patrick was really good at communicating. Marina and Ulf were also extremely friendly. Definitely hope to go again....
282586,251585397,2018-04-08,36601272,Tamara,This place made our stay Its a gorgeous cottage just as described but even more beautiful as it boasts a gorgeous patio over looking the sea.

282586,1036088472382930743,2023-11-30,9073349,Samantha,Lovely place to land in Cape Town with warm hosts and thoughtful touches throughout. Slightly less private than we had imagined we thought the main house would be empty but Marina and her family were wonderful and attentive hosts  and we were grateful we got to meet them. Some minor hiccups were fixed immediately and we very much appreciated their local recommendations.
282586,1069491611831207364,2024-01-15,2320565,Hendrik,Great apartment in one of the best neighborhoods. The family who owns it and also lives there is super nice and made us feel at home. Communication with Patrick is very easy and professional. Highly recommend it.

282586,1088339351395465111,2024-02-10,208222233,Masa,Wir werden definitiv wieder kommen. Tolle Kommunikation  wunderbarer privates Apartment  tolle Gegend und wir haben uns sehr sicher gefhlt  danke fr die Gastfreundschaft und den Support und fr die tollen Tipps.
282586,1091154486166397849,2024-02-14,10433153,Susan,We hebben een heerlijke tijd gehad bij Patrick en Marina. We verbleven in een hun gasten verblijf met priv terras  wat een verdieping lager ligt dan het zwembad maar dichtbij diverse heerlijk restaurants en strandjes.
282586,1111450750094474774,2024-03-13,26112407,Sini,Patrick and Marina are wonderful hosts - very kind  proactive and superb communication. They proactively  reached out to inform us that a construction site had started next door after we booked and offered a discounted stay to accommodate. The noise was still very intense  which definitely impacted the stay  but this was not in their control. The place is beautifully decorated with all amenities in top quality. We had interpreted the photos and description a bit differently and thought the pool was adjacent to the room  whereas in reality it is next to the Manor House up a staircase and through their private garden. As they are super welcoming and kind that is not a problem though. Well located walking distance from Seapoint and Clifton beach. Thank you for hosting us
282586,1114419562997415617,2024-03-17,396346366,Antonia,Wundervolle Gastgeberin  wundervolles Appartement in einer sehr sicheren Gegend Liebevoll eingerichtet und fantastisch ausgestattet. Es hatte alles von Strandhandtchern bis hin zu hilfreichen Reiseratgebern fr Kapstadt und Sdafrika. Wir haben wundervolle Tipps von der Gastgeberin bekommen  welche sich super viel Zeit fr uns genommen hatte und wirklich toll war. Das Appartement ist fulufig zu vielen Restaurants und Cafs gelegen  und in der Nhe von Camps Bay und Clifton. Wir wrden definitiv wiederkommen
282586,1136892491668864403,2024-04-17,42147812,Leanne,Really warm welcome from Marina. The flat is a beautiful space within the main houses foot print.  Very well equipped. There is currently building work noise from about 8am to 5pm but this is clearly not within the owners control and they discounted the apartment price because of this. Its not a problem if youre up early and out all day. Great location within walking distance of beautiful beaches and top notch restaurants
282586,1139740105765915740,2024-04-21,197749387,Eva,Patricks place was amazing Exactly as described  Patrick also allowed us to check in early as we were arriving much before check in. The place felt extremely safe and private. The views are wonderful from the terrace and the apartment had everything we could possibly need. Unfortunately we didnt get to have them but we also had some cheese crackers and chutney waiting for us. Absolutely wonderful host and apartment  would 100 return. Thank you Patrick 
771176,140693464,2017-03-31,109308328,Judi,Don and Patricia were excellent hosts. They offer a small booklet filled with important information about the city which is very helpful in getting around to see the things you wish to visit. I would recommend these lodgings to anyone visiting Cape Town.
771176,141824069,2017-04-05,34268718,Dolly,We loved the hosts. They were so helpful considering that we got to their place late. Don drove us to the nearest restaurant so we can have dinner. Their place is very clean and with great views of table mountain and lions head. It is in a safe neighborhood and very near the bus stop.
771176,143494640,2017-04-12,55561606,Inken,Don war ein perfekter Host Die Unterkunft bietet alles was das selbstversorger Herz begehrt. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die Gartendusche  die an warmen Tagen die perfekte Abkhlung verschafft. Don selbst ist eine hilfsbereite und herzensgute Person. Er hat uns bei smtlichen Schwierigkeiten geholfen  uns die Gegend mit Restaurants und Supermarkt gezeigt und zum Abschluss unsere Route durch Sdafrika mitgeplant. Seine Hilfen waren sehr wertvoll fr uns und wir wrden ihn jederzeit wieder als Host buchen. Danke Don.
771176,145405680,2017-04-18,44000065,Anne-Katrina Kalyani,Grosse Hilfsbereitschaft  gute Tips  freundliche  herzliche Gastgeber. Geschmackvolle Einrichtung sauber  sehr gutes Preisleistungsverhltnis.

771176,162981627,2017-06-23,134937450,Cyrus,Incredible  loving   passionate and above all humane and caring hosts where one would feel the warmth of one's own family amidst a tranquil environment at the foot of the Table Mountain. Walking distance to shops and restaurants with easy access to public transport.
771176,165185918,2017-06-30,15747036,Natasha,Don's place is a wonderful home away from home. This was my second time staying here and I would do it again in an instant. It's warm  private  has a wonderful character and feel to it like there's a story in every piece that makes the space. The complimentary wine  cheese and bread are always an amazing treat after a long stint of field work. Even though I didn't managed to this round  Don is always a fantastic and interesting host to talk to and exchange stories of adventure with. I highly recommend this place. You wont be disappointed.
771176,166736499,2017-07-04,54817607,Anelda,Fantastic location with lots of space . Great safe off-street parking. Don is a very helpful and considerate host that goes the extra mile and some more.
771176,177041492,2017-08-01,3579062,Justin,I had a wonderful time here  and it was exactly the vibe I needed after a 2 month long trip working in the Cederberg Mountains.  You're a fool not to stay here.
771176,189489644,2017-09-02,51100747,John,Ideal location . If using a GPS put in the area code as there are 2 Florida Streets . Easy to get both into and out of the city . Great host
771176,197417039,2017-09-25,1030133,Yonit,Great place and location. Hosts provide amazing and personalized guide book for all guests  and are extremely welcoming. I'd recommend to anyone.
771176,207145313,2017-10-28,2706081,Mateusz,Great location. Quiet and clear place. Very friendly and helpful hosts. Everything frictionless.
771176,211756556,2017-11-14,19046977,A J,Probably particularly attractive to tourists coming from outside South Africa looking for some ethnic color. Good size space and location - which can be very windy also in certain seasons. Bed is a smaller double bed
771176,213196847,2017-11-20,96805061,Hanna,Enjoyed the little touches that Don put in the apartment. After traveling for so long  it was so nice to see wine  cheese  and crackers waiting.
771176,213961864,2017-11-24,25355762,Sterling And Jade,Really lovely space in a quiet neighborhood in Vredehoek. Don and his wife are lovely and have such an eclectic home with bits and bobs from all over. A real travelers traveler. The flat is super quiet and comfortable with everything you need for a great base in Cape Town
771176,215683302,2017-12-01,107408194,HansKurt,We stayed four nights at Dons. Could not be better  Vredeshoek is a very nice neighbourhood  calm and cosy environment. The accomodation was real cool place with own kitchen and bathroom  you also got own key to safe Parking lot inside. On top of that its s very nice couple as host  we had to move further on our Journey but had liked to stay longer. This is just a perfect stay out from all perspectives. Everything was to our satisfaction. Hans  Amy  Eskilstuna  Sweden
771176,219008105,2017-12-16,4727131,Miguel,Don was a great host and the room was perfect great location  very clean  and comfortable.
282606,3449483,2013-01-31,1719431,Dimitri,I really enjoyed staying with Katrine's family. You feel at home after 2 minutes Very hospital  very friendly  funny and warm people. I absolutly recommend a stay in this beautiful house.
282606,3897657,2013-03-25,528946,Julie,To say that I went from my home in Miami to my home in South Africa would not be an exaggeration.  Katrine made me feel so welcomed from the minute I met her.  Later on I met the rest of the family and I can honestly say I have grown attached to all of them  and of course  that has to do with the way they make you feel.  They are all so warm and welcoming  not to mention very accommodating and helpful with suggestions as to what to do in Cape Town and the nearby cities.  I feel they went far and beyond what would be expected of any Airbnb host.  I am looking forward to the opportunity of visiting Cape Town again  and if I do  I would love to stay with this family again.  Thank you all so much You've added to the wonderful memories of Cape Town that I shall cherish for ever  o
282606,7822944,2013-10-04,5919328,Marieke,Very welcoming and friendly. Would highly recommend staying here
282606,8493667,2013-11-02,234660,Carol,Best BnB in Cape Town.  I loved staying there.  Katrine and her family were very welcoming and made everything very homey and easy.  The house is big and comfortable  the room sweet very comfortable bed and what a treat to have a long hot bath both night It felt like a home away from home. They even lent me a raincoat  I highly recommend it and plan on staying there on my next trip to Cape Town.
282606,8752611,2013-11-16,7570839,Heidi,I have to be honest and say that I spent much more time with Katrine's mom  Gaby  than I did with Katrine. Our ages and experiences matched better  but Katrine and her sister and of course  her dad are wonderful  kind people. The room is clean and the home is nestled amongst several varieties of plants and flowers. The house is in a residential southern suburb of Cape Town. For this reason  it might be best to rent a car if you're planning on going into the city since nights in South Africa are a mixed bag of safety issues and riding public transportation at night is definitely not recommended. I was looking for a family that would be able to show me insights into South African society and I learned a lot with this family. Gaby brought me to an extended family dinner  an event at her workplace  the movies and for a lovely drive and lunch in the Newlands area.
282606,9021214,2013-12-02,2748782,Katie,Katrine and her family were fabulous host. Cant wait to stay with them again
771176,222505820,2017-12-30,9962161,Damian,Had a great stay here  lovely place in a very pleasant neighbourhood  with great views of Table Mountain.  Don who lives next door was very friendly and available to offer advice whenever needed. Highly recommended.
771176,225064162,2018-01-05,50910918,Alice,Wir hatten eine schne Zeit bei Don. Die Wohnung liegt in einem sehr schnem Wohngebiet. Ein Supermarkt und Restaurants sind nur 10 Minuten entfernt. Von der Longstreet aus luft man ca 50 Minuten. Die Gegend erschien uns sehr sicher. Auch ist die Terasse von Don toll um abends den Tag gemtlich bei einer Flasche Wein ausklingen zu lassen. Zu dem hatte Don uns Brot Wein Keckse und Kse vorbereitet was wirklich sehr nett war.
771176,226336831,2018-01-10,9453281,Joseph,La casa esta lindo  en una zona uniquo y callado de la ciudad.  Vas a recibir cualquier apoyo necesitas.

771176,238637721,2018-02-26,2686378,Bernard,Don and Patricia defines Airbnb spririt Their place is wonderful  the outside shower is top  but the best is their hospitality. We were there to film a documentary and they were more than helpful with their knowledge  books and information. They even helped us contact with a University professor to interview for our film. In terms of Airbnb experience it will be difficult to top that one...
771176,242784316,2018-03-13,158820768,Cornelius,Lovely place to stay  very friendly and helpful people  would definitely recommend it
771176,244102493,2018-03-18,11601322,Wibeke,Don und Patrizia sind wunderbare Gastgeber  hilfsbereit  sehr nett und freundlich und sie haben uns wertvolle Tipps ber Kapstadt gegeben.
771176,245409828,2018-03-22,38499908,Colette,Absolutely amazing Friendly and communicative. Place is big. Comfortable. We loved the outdoor shower Loved the snacks that were left especially after hours of travel and being all messed up time wise. Great location to walk to wonderful restaurants. Very safe. Loved it
771176,248734240,2018-04-01,165558813,Cathy,Don and Patricia are amazing hosts. I felt very welcome fruit  biscuits  red wine  stuffed olives and bagels on arrival. I was in Cape Town to run the two Oceans Half Marathon. They wished me well prior to the race with a wonderful  humorous story written by Don who is a journalist of how as humans we are made to run. They were very thoughtful and generous hosts. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
771176,279619229,2018-06-21,163682454,Andrea,Don went out of his way to be hospitible  leaving a generous spread of welcome treats for our arrival  and plenty of ideas for visiting the city. He's a professional traveler eager to share tips  but not at all overbearing. The space was artistic and pleasant to be in. It's well worth the price  and we would certainly stay here again if we are ever back in Capetown.
771176,283179866,2018-06-29,387193,Jeff,Don and Patricia are spectacular hosts who well deserve their rating as Superhosts.  The stay was fantastic in every detail  from the oranges and bottle of wine they provided to the extensive conversation I had with Don the morning after I arrived.  I had to go to the airport a bit later than the standard checkout time  and they graciously accommodated me by letting me leave my backpack at the place until it was time to go.  They also let me borrow an umbrella when Cape Town unexpectedly had rain.   All in all  an outstanding experience that I highly recommend.
771176,288123300,2018-07-09,55916619,Heather,Loved everything about this place. Beautiful location  great host  lovely decor. The back patio was my favorite part. Will stay again for sure.
771176,306087398,2018-08-12,43426918,Elma,We loved the place and the bottle of wine  cheese and bagels were so thoughtful.
771176,312352803,2018-08-23,67122561,Sierra,Amazing hospitality We loved the little touches  like a bottle of wine and bread that made our first day after a long day of plane rides and jet lag a little bit easier. We were even invited to the local farmers market what a special first morning The outdoor shower is phenomenal even when it is cold  it is worth taking a shower outside the water is hot. They are both accomplished  intelligent writers who offer highly interesting conversation. They are also easily accessible should you need any help. Dont miss out on this gem
282606,9380875,2013-12-25,2748782,Katie,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay again They made me feel like part of the family. Highly recommended for everyone.

282606,10958130,2014-03-15,11856758,Sandrine,A great experience  a beautiful living room with Katrine and her family are very nice people  helpful. Their home and beautiful Victorian type we all amenities in the house  otherwise the downtown Claremont is 10 minutes walk. There are any  I am athletic  I could exercise in a comprehensive sports complex. I really enjoyed myself. Otherwise the station is 8 minutes walk is very convenient. You can eat in the evening Katrine  and for my part I ate there every night and I really enjoyed myself. I say more  I loved I was very attached to the family of Katrine  I shared a great time. They dj.Mme I miss the maid is super nice. Voila. I strongly recommend you to Katrine. This is a real favorite.
282606,13399655,2014-05-27,11008939,Allison,Stumbling across this amazing family contributed to the most amazing experience of my life. I felt so welcomed by the whole family who took me under their wing as this was my first trip on my own. The room and the rest of the house was gorgeous and kept to a very high standard. The home is ideally placed with easy access to local amenities and central to most site seeing areas close by. If you are looking for a comfortable  fulfilling  friendly place to stay whilst on your adventure I highly recommend staying with this wonderful family who welcome you with open arms
282606,15150016,2014-07-03,15842249,Ritesh,I had a lovely time staying with the family. Katrine herself wasn't in town but her father made sure that I was comfortable and well taken care of. The house itself is beautiful and in a great location  close to the Main Road  there is a lovely pizza place down the road that Andries took me to  I still dream of the pizza on most days. We had long conversations over the days and the wine just tasted way sweeter when you have great company. I almost didn't feel like leaving. Overall I had an awesome time staying with them  needless to say  highly recommended.
282606,23287741,2014-11-27,23796956,Nadia,Amazing stay with such an amazing family In stayed with Katrine and her family for one day and have never felt more at home  such a lovely place to stay and with such a welcoming host. Great location and beautiful home. I had a lovely home cooked meal when I arrived  they where all so informative  giving me great tips on places to visit and restaurants to eat at. My first choice by far for when I visit Cape Town again in the future.
282606,23473359,2014-12-01,19941616,Nina,Katrine and her family welcomed me into their house like an old friend. I felt right at home and they have me such good advice to see the beautiful city of Capetown. The house is located next to shops and transport into the city. It's a safe neighbourhood with loads of charm. Thank you for hosting me 
282606,27626344,2015-03-08,6887041,Kai,This place is how airbnb should be From the first moment I felt at home with Katrine and her family. They are all such lovely and easy going people. Very helpful but not intrusive  and if you want you can be involved with family life like having dinner together chipping in for food  but you can also do your own thing. Highly recommended.
282606,48081741,2015-09-23,7381759,Esther,What a wonderful place Lovely room and lovely people They were very eager to tell me where to go and what one must see. It was all Spot-On I loved sharing a bit of the family life here. It was so nice I would defenitely come back here. Oh yes  and do try the Milktart at Oakhurst farm just around the corner.
282606,50880205,2015-10-15,45655998,Eugene,Warm  welcoming  friendly are just some of the words that come to my mind to describe this lovely family. Lots of great energy that made the time spent with them absolutely enjoyable and memorable. The personal and genuine interest in my well-being was very special indeed.
282606,127136016,2017-01-16,70930510,Taryn,The best Private Room Airbnb that I have ever experienced. Great family  beautiful house  lovely atmosphere. Walking distance to grocery store  restaurants  Bootlegger coffee  Sorbet salon and many more.  I felt so at home.
282606,129490246,2017-01-31,42048632,Mirjam,Incredibly welcoming atmosphere You will be living with a remarkably friendly  warm and open-minded family. My friend and I were included into their everyday lives as all of us had supper together or went to the Kirstenbosch Craft and Food Market. Andries  the host father  even took us on a Cape Point tour. Hence  I had a great time staying at 10 Bisset Road
282606,131856004,2017-02-14,50306542,Christian,Katrine and her family are absolutely lovely people. They made me feel at home right away and were always there to help. They are very interesting to talk to  openminded and it was a pleasure for me meeting them. We even shared several activities together like cycling or a trip to the old biscuit mill in Woodstock  but they also respected my private space. The house is in a safe and quiet area close to super markets  restaurants  shopping malls and coffee shops I recommend Bootleggers if you are looking for strong Wifi. To go to the city center you can just get an Uber or grab a bus taxi in the street. If you look for a lovely home to stay in Cape Town with a local family - this is the perfect place.

282606,1096282751611198394,2024-02-21,83013504,Berenice,I could not have found a more perfect oasis for a fortnight as I did in this very old characterful  creative family home with tropical garden full of birds. There are plenty of spaces for quiet privacy or interesting engagement with Andries and Gaby. The place exudes love  peace and joy.

So I highly recommend them.

283053,949280,2012-02-26,1413168,Daniel,We stayed in the main huge apartment  2 twin bedrooms with comfy mattress. You are very lucky if you can book this apartment on your desired dates. It is located very close to V  A waterfront in a quiet neighbourhood. The interior is decorated delightfully with Stuart's carefully selected furnishings. It is fully kitted with everything you may require plus very good quality Saeco coffee machine which pleasures any real coffee lovers
283053,1051867,2012-03-27,1814652,Nick,This is an exceptional place - great location  the apartment is tastefully decorated  and well laid out.  All amenities are provided down to sewing kit and beach umbrella.  Great for foodies - well equipped kitchen.  All round good experience.

771176,326488060,2018-09-22,67302527,Lynn,Such a wonderful home that truly is African Sun - full of beautiful character and the warmest hospitality. The spacious apartment with garden and fully equipped kitchenette is even bigger and lovelier than it looks in photos. Great wifi  fab location super close to table mountain  signal hill etc. and with several cafes within walking distance  and the bonus outdoor shower is a mini adventure in itself there's also a regular indoor shower  Wine and snacks were the loveliest welcoming touch  and hosts were so accomodating to our travel schedule.  So blessed to have had the opportunity to experience the warmth of African Sun  absolutely the best place to stay while in Capetown

771176,336295797,2018-10-14,71978147,Joe,What a fantastic place to stay and almost feels like home...better than home even As Don mentions somewhere in his own review the place seems bigger than it appears in the photos. There is just enough storage space in the room to pack away all your things  the linen on the beds will make you want to show up late in the mornings and the outside shower is priceless. I arrived on my stay and was given the run down by Don  he's a great guy and had offered up a wedge of brie  some bread rolls  fresh strawberries and the famous bottle of wine waiting for me in the kitchen. I had some late meetings in the evenings and it was so nice to come back to the property to find motion sensor lights than line the property. Makes it really comforting coming back at night being able to see which key you need. Great stay I'll be back to the African Sun
771176,338264038,2018-10-19,10438905,Dave,Don was an great guest with some special attention. The apartment is great in a quiet place. Un grand merci

The two beds 1 double bed  1 single bed are comfortable  everything in the house worked well warm water  electric gates etc. and if there was anything you needed you could always ask Don and Patricia for help. We enjoyed the quiet and lovely neighbourhood and how the place is located in the city.  There was easy access to restaurants  cafs  as well as to the highway to take a ride outside the city. Above all the nice amenities it was Don and Patricia's hospitality which we enjoyed the most. They were so helpful  nice to chat with  provided us with great tips and just gave us a really good feeling. We can definitely recommend this place Thank you so much

The location is perfect  just by table mountain with amazing hikes and runs  close to some lovely restaurants and within easy distance of central Cape Town. Don and his wife were super welcoming and accommodating  making things so stress free for our first long haul travel with our 6 month year old baby. We loved chatting to don  and the fact that he got the perfect balance between leaving us to ourselves and being around to answer questions and chat.
771176,412340190,2019-02-15,74278324,Emily,Don and Pat are very friendly and helpful. You'll have your own part of the house with a kitchen  bathroom  and warm and cozy bedroom.

771176,539887352,2019-10-02,296694992,,They listened to our request and were satisfied in many ways 
283053,4841878,2013-05-28,3141054,Audrey,This house is amazing.  It has even more oceanside charm than the pictures show  and the views of Cape Town are beautiful from the bay window.  It's also in a great location for walking to restaurants in Green Point and Sea Point.  We couldn't have been happier with our visit  and we'd love to stay at Braeside when we travel back to Cape Town
283053,8409545,2013-10-29,1186130,Johannes,We fell in love with that place when we first stepped in. It's even more gorgeous than it appears on the pictures. The apartment offers everything you need and more a perfectly equipped kitchen  bathrobes  a braai BBQ in the backyard and a seaview from one of the bedrooms. It's nice and safe but also close to beaches and city. The maid who is very nice uses the same entrance and the laundry room in the apartment. So you better use the bathrobe - Stuart was a great host and very laid-back. He was always there when we needed help.
283053,9784038,2014-01-10,9291271,Robin,Stuart was very friendly and helpful with advice on places to visit.  The apartment is huge  and having laundry facilities was very appreciated.
283053,9885250,2014-01-17,1880069,Brenda,Braeside is the place to stay when in Cape Town.  It is so very close to the ocean  restaurants  the Victoria and Albert Mall  the soccer stadium and more  Stuart was a wonderful host  giving us advice on which wineries to visit while touring Stellenbosch as well as helping us make arrangements for local transport.  The apartment is spacious  well decorated  and comfortable for a larger crowd.  There were 9 of us traveling together  and although some stayed at another hostel next door  we would gather at Braeside for breakfast  card games and more.  A fabulous place and host
283053,10751273,2014-03-05,3691482,Chris,We had a wonderful 4 days staying at Braeside House. Stuart was a fabulous host and he remained in constant contact from the time we started the booking process.  He quickly responded to confirm availability and gave us excellent directions to the house.  Everything was perfectly set-out. Huge bedroom at the front with a monstrous ensuite bathroom with great bath and shower and twin basins. Wifi works well and there is a great TV in the lounge.  It's so close to VA Waterfront  the ocean and all other places on interest.  Camps Bay is 10 mins and a 1.5 hour drive to Cape Point and Good Hope.  Honestly  Capetown was brilliant and Braeside complimented everything we wanted to do there. Thanks Stuart.
283053,10971549,2014-03-15,11802735,Lloyd,Braeside House will become my home away from home for any return trips to Cape Town  The main apartment overlooking the Atlantic Ocean has an authentic old world charm that is both grand and warmly welcoming.  The refreshing Cape Town breeze drifts through the apartment to the courtyard garden at the rear  perfect for relaxing with a good book or newspaper.  The kitchen is fully equipped for self-catering with a real espresso coffee machine  and Stuart even stocks some essential items in the fridge.  The wifi is very reliable.  Overall  a great place in a great location.  I'll be back
283053,15433479,2014-07-08,1514962,Julia,Braeside House is a great place for a weekend stay or longer  if you're lucky. Set in a quiet neighborhood not too far from the Waterfront  Stadium  and a lively Main Street  the house is spacious  bright and beautifully decorated. I'll definitely book here again next time I'm in Cape Town.
283053,18741125,2014-08-31,263321,Kris,Great apartment with more luxury and space than we ever expected. We were also big fan of the coffee machine  helping us getting up in the morning. This apartment has everything  even a massage chair We were a bit surprised of having live-in staff without being told in advance but we did have enough privacy in the end  so this was okay.
283053,19852814,2014-09-19,11961907,Collette,Braeside House is ideally situated for exploring Cape Town with many attractions and great dining in comfortable walking distance. Stuart was a great host  left us to do our thing but made sure we had everything we needed  including a camp cot for our baby. The main house in which we stayed is beautiful  spacious yet cosy and has a quirk in it's decor that is typically Capetonian. The coffee machine was fantastic. The beds were comfortable and the linen fresh and crisp. Really  we loved it all.
283053,20655449,2014-10-03,2366791,Mojo,Enjoyed my stay in Capetown and the quiet residential area of Green Point made it even more relaxed with incredible views of Waterfront. Stuart was helpful but not intrusive respecting guest's space and privacy. The apartment is very spacious with 2 large double bedrooms and amazing bathrooms en suite. Great kitchen where he leaves supplies for breakfast and access to a lovely patio area in the back to eat outside. Stuart also helped me book taxi to airport and made sure I was sorted for my return trip. Thank you.
283053,21292136,2014-10-14,20980128,Patrick,We felt really welcome at Braeside House. It's an amazing location  close to the city center with a beautiful view.

We look forward to returning to Cape Town and this wonderful rental. Both he and the live-in housekeeper were a joy.
771176,550658537,2019-10-19,255450732,Christiaan,A wonderful place on a quite street up on the mountainside  with walking trails nearby that hold magnificent views  and town just down the hill. There are some really nice restaurants and cafes just a few blocks away. The living space and outdoor patio are very pleasant. Don and Patricia are hospitable  easy-going  and highly creative people.

771176,565900278,2019-11-18,44235314,Marlo,African Sun was a great spot for a weekend visit to the Mother City. The place is clean  comfortable - and well located. Parking is bonus - and rare in Cape Town. The welcome snack was a nice touch. Our host  Don  was responsive and there to provide a warm welcome. Oh yes  visitors have to try the outdoor shower - an absolute treat
771176,569947882,2019-11-28,133481903,Miguel,Very helpful hosts . I would choose the same place if I would return to South Africa. A beautiful area close to many of the most interesting places in Cape Town
771176,572221181,2019-12-02,24477655,Theresa,Don and Patricia are very lovely hosts 
771176,575032097,2019-12-09,14887358,Elyse,Absolutely lovely Check in process was easy  and Don took me on a drive around the local area and recommended some restaurants. They were very flexible with my check in time  and stayed in touch leading up to my stay. The space itself is lovely too  nice privacy. They were also very understanding when my ride picked me up early in the morning and rang the doorbell before I got outside  sorry again
771176,579233939,2019-12-20,240822365,Chris,Very clean  cosy and well situated place with friendly hosts.
771176,581928686,2019-12-26,29934441,Claudia,Patricia and Don are warm and welcoming hosts. The apartment had everything I needed and I felt very much at home. I couldnt find a better place in Cape Town.
771176,587525273,2020-01-03,49379344,Tessa,Don is an amazing host and the home is in a great location. We loved the view of the mountain and spending time on the back patio.
771176,593198136,2020-01-15,896239,Amy-Lea And Lawrence,We really enjoyed our stay at African Sun. It is in a safe and quiet neighborhood and the accommodation had everything we needed. We especially enjoyed the location under the mountain  yummy muffins on arrival and the outdoor shower - The hosts are interesting to chat to and it is worth taking the time to get know them. They were available when needed by also respected our privacy. They have been running this Airbnb for years and as a result everything is well thought out
771176,595955329,2020-01-21,31564267,Almuth,Don und Patricia sind sehr freundliche Gastgeber  sehr bemht und gleichzeitig diskret. Die Unterkunft ist schn und ich habe den Aufenthalt genossen.
771176,601732855,2020-02-04,29443831,Jolana,Good hospitality  dedicated hosts   excellent location.
283053,26970957,2015-02-23,8280779,Wanda,A return visit to Braeside House was another success. Superb location  everything one needs with great space  finishing touches and an attentive yet unobtrusive host. Fabulous
283053,28998919,2015-04-02,14627672,Radhika,The property was exactly as described. It is a beautiful and spacious apartment. Amenities were well provided and the apartment is situated very well. Stuart was friendly and helpful  even in some of his suggestions before we arrived. We really enjoyed our stay in Braeside House. Thank you Stuart.
283053,30609800,2015-04-25,9291591,Jenna,Staying at the Braeside House was wonderful. The house is actually more beautiful in person than the pictures show  and I thought the pictures were lovely. Stuart is very relaxed  as most of the people we met in South Africa were. He was around to help with any little thing we needed and was also out of sight leaving space for privacy. The housekeeper does live in a space just off the main house and came and went through the house that we rented. It was not a problem at all for us  however if you are looking for total privacy  this may not work for you as there is a modicum of sharing. The bathtubs in both bathrooms were divine for soaking after long days of walking. The location was perfect for a home base for many daily adventures. We walked to the waterfront  The Bo Kaap  downtown and many shops and restaurants nearby. We navigated the whole city by bus and rented a car only one day to go see the Penguins. When I return to Cape Town  I would love to rent from Stuart again.
283053,47459005,2015-09-19,421956,Shirley,Neighborhood was great though none of the taxi drivers seem to know the area it's a tiny street. Use Uber instead - cheaper It is very close to the waterfront  the beaches in camps bay and a half hour walk to the shops on Long Street in the city center  for reference. The house itself is very spacious and as photographed. We did see the house cleaner and her daughter on a few occasions but they were quiet. Stuart who lives downstairs was very quick to answer our questions and helped us arrange airport transfer so that was fantastic. Only thing that bothered me was the loudness in the loft apartment but it may just be the thinner walls associated with an older house. The gale force winds were much more louder than any noise from other guests. I'd definitely stay here again if I'm back in Capetown. Very homey feel
283053,49090416,2015-10-01,15472067,Maya,The Braeside main apartment exceeded my expectations in terms of size  comfort and location.  The rooms were pleasantly appointed and the sheets and pillows spotless. Stuart has a superior coffee machine in the kitchen and an array of utensils to suit one's cooking needs. Quiet neighborhood  central to the VA waterfront  downtown  restaurants and activities.  The Unicab service was exceptional  and the taxis were driven by uniformed cabbies who arrived within 10 minutes of calling. Address was easy to get to. You won't be disappointed.  I'm already planning my next trip and Braeside will be part of it.
283053,53743806,2015-11-12,20615588,Claudia,Wij hebben een fantastisch verblijf gehad in Braeside house. Het huis is nog mooier dan de foto's laten zien. Bij aankomst was er een gevulde ijskast  iemand die ons alles uitlegde en een goede handleiding. De buurt is mooi  veilig en heel fijn om van daaruit Kaapstad te ontdekken. Wij zullen deze accommodatie zeker aanraden aan vrienden en bekenden.
283053,59279070,2016-01-09,8572295,Steph,We were thrilled with our stay at Braeside House and Stuart was a wonderful host. He was fantastic with communicating and addressing our questions - from providing a letter for visas  to accommodating travel delays affecting our arrival time  to even printing out tickets for our visits to Robben Island and Table Mountain. The house was immaculately kept - from the dining room to the fairly spacious bedrooms and bathrooms with towels and bathrobes - and had everything we needed washer and dryer  kitchen items  etc.. The location is great - a short taxi ride to the VA Waterfront or 30 min walk  quiet and pleasant neighborhood. Stuart also provided tip sheets and had several guidebooks in the flat which were super helpful for us in trip planning. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Cape Town and would absolutely recommend others to stay here

771176,727439224,2021-01-29,339635262,Sarita,A lovely place with a lot of space. Truly a rare find in Cape Town.
771176,735631698,2021-03-01,61985130,Maddy,I had a wonderful two-week stay at African Sun. The flat itself is  as many reviewers have noted  more spacious than it appears in the photos. The private patio made for a delightfully sunny spot for coffee in the mornings  and the bush shower a total treat.  Great location too easy walking distance to the shops in Derry St as well as to Gardens Centre  and a stone's throw to Deer Park's myriad trails. Don and Patricia were exceedingly thoughtful and generous throughout my stay  and are both very interesting people who are involved in fascinating work do ask them about it. Thanks so much - glad we'll be neighbours
771176,738820583,2021-03-14,57740065,Fanie,It is a clean place and quiet place with everything I needed for my stay. The hosts are interesting and hospitable people and always ready to help.
771176,506989623515176659,2021-11-30,80870745,Jenna,I stayed in African Sun for over one month and felt completely at home. Don and Patricia are not only generous and kind hosts but such interesting  wonderful people. Both of them are accomplished writers Don is a journalisttravel writer and Patricia writes fiction and poetry and have a wealth of knowledge about South Africa and beyond. They will happily share their travel tips as well as stories of their own experiences and adventures over tea. The bookshelf in the bedroom is abundantly stocked with high-quality guidebooks and some of Don's own works. The apartment is colourful  peaceful  and private  but Don and Patricia are just a door away. They've taken care to incorporate thoughtful touches into the space and also anticipated the needs of a traveller. On top of this  the wifi is reliable  and the beds are comfy two of my must-haves as a long-term travellerdigital nomad. The house is secure and in a safe neighbourhood  and I felt no unease walking around on my own. A few minutes' walk will also you bring you to contour paths along Table Mountain.

771176,535973201256044929,2022-01-09,12311961,Julie,We had a lovely four night stay at African Sun. Don is a charming host and made us feel quite at home. I especially enjoyed the outdoor shower there is one indoors too. The location is good and easy to access with safe off-street parking and a lovely secluded patio at the back.  Very quiet  safe and peaceful.
771176,548303510270650623,2022-01-26,80870745,Jenna,After my first stay in African Sun  I decided to re-book after extending my time in Cape Town. Everything from my earlier review applies--I love this place

771176,671584063365163699,2022-07-15,953982,Russell,It's always a pleasure staying at Don's. He's a gracious host and great with communication. The property is super central  so you have access to pretty much anything you need  and there's also off-street parking  which is ideal for Cape Town. The apartment itself is always clean  quiet and convenient to access with its own separate entrance. Easily my favourite place to stay in Cape Town's city bowl.
771176,691798416668496746,2022-08-12,175416746,Andi,Lovely quiet spot in the heart of Vredehoek. Walking distance to shops and restaurants and a ten minute drive to the city centre. The place was very comfortable and well maintained  with many thoughtful little touches. There is secure parking and I felt extremely safe. Don is a fantastic host - always happy to be of service and very considerate. I would definitely stay again.

Greenpoint is a fantastic location for walking and Ubering around town. We also loved the small touches - fresh bread and juice  an amazing coffee machine  bath gowns  and frequent servicing by the cleaner. Thank you Stuart for a lovely stay
283053,134021682,2017-02-25,15472067,Maya,It is secluded  quiet and charming.  Spacious  clean  crisp linens and huge bathrooms.  Very central  yet peaceful to assure a restful stay.
283053,135068454,2017-03-03,4507382,Maria,This place is a gem. I hardly want to advertise it because it might get too booked for me to come again  The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The location  great.  Stuart  a fine dedicated gentleman of a host. You will enjoy it here
283053,400797384,2019-01-13,9101313,Jan,I agree with other reviewers that this is a lovely place to stay and explore Cape town. The facilities are fine and the location superb. Its a quiet neighborhood  and close to the waterfront. We rented a car  to explore the Cape Town  region and thats highly recommended.

283053,735060099,2021-02-28,49157090,Nolene,We stayed here for a month - it is the perfect longstay accommodation.
283053,496090994919307671,2021-11-15,72635191,Andreas,A large  beautifully furnished Victorian apartment in the old part of Greenpoint  close to a fanatastic park and the seaside. I was by myself  so it felt a bit too big.
283053,509171402593637311,2021-12-03,53113304,Sarah,Beautiful flat in the heart of Green Point.
283053,540350743127771873,2022-01-15,5682162,Annika,Our much loved home away from home We enjoyed our stay at Braeside House so very much. It is homely  beautiful  equipped with everything you need  a huge living area  kitchen  2 very pretty bedrooms with en suites and very comfy beds. We also enjoyed the outdoor area which provides shade on those hot summer days and also sun for sunbathing. The location is fantastic  in a small quiet road in probably one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in CT  close to everything. My brother and I spent 2 months here  working remotely and the place was big enough to give us  the space we needed and fast  reliable wifi. Both Tarisa and Agata are lovely and we didn't mind their presence at all. On the contrary  we felt so spoiled having them keep the apartment nice and clean. Stuart is a very nice host  he was always there when we needed him  he's very respectful and always responded super fast. We'll be sad to leave but already looking forward to our next stay. Thank you Stuart for providing such a great Airbnb experience
283053,628827171961894055,2022-05-17,132136430,Daniel,A lovely well equipped place  very comfortable. Location is lovely  10-15 minute walk to the seaside promenade and some great restaurants.
283053,748368134555597558,2022-10-29,78436247,Kim,A nice heritage house that has all the old world Cape Town charm you could want. Spacious and comfortable. A well stocked kitchen even egg cups which I liked and a good bean-fed coffee machine which I liked more.  Clean and nice linen.  Stuart kindly provided some fresh bread and jam which was great as we came in late.  A lack of hot water as the heat pump had given up we were only told on arrival detracted a bit as did the creaking floors and wooden windows that dont shut and rattle a lot in the wind.  Also if the above loft flat is rented the overhead creaking may keep you up thankfully only 2 nights of this. We were out most of the day  so the helper coming through the lounge to exit onto the road didnt worry us.   Close enough to the main attractions and the promenade which offered great early morning running.  Thank you for accommodating us for the week.

286894,4434917,2013-05-05,209302,Lloyd,One of the nicest places I've stayed with airbnb so far.

778089,1064314022316088602,2024-01-08,80711760,Karen,Beautiful location ..  no ocean view but plenty of sound of breaking waves   Lovely place to walk around with very friendly locals.  We dined out - and enjoyed eating in too .    Perfect place for a family reconnecting from various corners of the globe.  The outside terrace is so private and delightful .. six of us could enjoy the space with ease.
778089,1088977751542861225,2024-02-11,71501997,Margo,We had a wonderful weekend at Heather's place. Ideal for a 4 couples as each room has its own en suite. House was neat and clean and location is great.
782166,3244556,2013-01-03,1975727,Stephanie And Tim,We stayed here in December over New years. Chris's place was very cosy. It had a small kitchenette with sink  microwave and fridge. A large bathroom with bathtub  comfortable large bed  wifi  TV with good channels  and a small patio outside to enjoy the fresh air.  You can also use the washing machine to do any laundry.  The location is perfect  the street is safe and within walking distance to restaurants and shopping in Green Point. Although I would recommend hiring a car in CT. Chris and his wife were very accommodating  they offered us books and maps for hiking trails in cape town and made sure that we were very comfortable. If you want to find a quiet  safe place to sleep in CT this is the place for you.  Its a simple place and I would not suggest for long holidays where you want to relax indoors. But if you are like Tim and I  we like to get out and see the city  its perfect. Thank you chris for the lovely stay and being such a lovely host.  Happy New year
286894,23847281,2014-12-12,4696119,David,Had a wonderful stay in an apartment  which is not adequately complimented by its profile on Airbnb.  The pictures don't do it justice and the finishing touches make it both charming and practical.  Paul was accessible and helpful throughout the period.

782166,169053150,2017-07-11,1135126,Kathryn,Chris' home is perfect for a large group 9 like ours. We loved that everyone had their own en suite bathroom and that the common areas were large enough for us all to be together comfortably. The location is great - within walking distance to many restaurants  a grocery store and attractions like the VA Waterfront. Other attractions are easily accessed with Uber or taxis. Chris gave us wonderful recommendations for restaurants  bars  things to do and even helped us coordinate a private chef for a birthday dinner celebration at the house for a couple of our travel mates. We had a wonderful time exploring Cape Town and the Wessels House is a great base to do so. We all recommend the Wessels House without hesitation

His house is very well located and gave us a good basis to start the day. The highlight is the super cool pool which we used a lot. We highly recommend this place.
782208,28148389,2015-03-18,19576946,Tom,Chris went above and beyond the call of duty  even before we arrived at his beautiful home  We unfortunately arrived in Cape Town just as the city was shutting down for Carnival.  After a frustrating hour of trying every bypass  Chris walked about a mile from his house  convinced the police he needed to get to his house and then drove my rental car there to meet me  Fantastic.  The home is definitely understated in the description  it's a wonderful space with much privacy yet conveniently located to the waterfront  downtown and a host of great local restaurants.  After a dozen airbnb experiences I would rate Chris and his home as 1  Cleanliness-5 star 2 As described-5 star 3 Location- 5 star.  We had a wonderful time and only wished we'd have stayed longer.  I'll be back for a long term rental there.

A really nice touch was the short tutorial videos on how to use certain things and need-to-know elements of the apartment - saves having to read manuals. The apartment is in a great location close to restaurant  supermarkets and close walking distance to the Sea Point promenade. A lovely  quiet apartment block  very spacious apartment  great amenities and excellent for short or long stays. I will definitely return and highly recommend Pauls place.

Your love for your house  life and your city is contagious and from the moment we received your email asking for arrival details so you could arrange the complimentary transfer what a joy after a midnight arrival  till the time we left our luggage to accommodate a last-minute whale watching tour  we have smiled. The house is special - beautifully designed  light and spacious  the kitchen and bathrooms are fantastic  and what a beautiful outdoor space... We loved the attention for detail breakfast essentials  the use of your old cell phone and the stash of public transportation cards made life easy  so did the location walking distance from shops  restaurants  downtown and the waterfront. A fabulous stay in a fabulous city - absolutely recommended for everyone who wants to experience the quality of life in Cape Town. We will be back

782208,57359367,2015-12-25,12585900,Matt,Chris was personally engaged with ensuring we felt safe and comfortable  so that we might revel in the aesthetic of being on holiday. A gorgeous home in a great location  the space is clean  secure  fully furnished  etc. My family enjoyed breaking bread in the backyard  swimming  and having a go with the brie. Highly recommended for families. Grocery store is 200m away  down a somewhat heroic hill. If jet lagged  mosey down to the harbour for sunrise. Thanks Chris
782208,57862086,2015-12-30,33148133,Otto,This is a true oasis in Cape Town - Chris' house exceeded our expectations it was large  clean  light and trendy. Well equipped and including a pool.

782208,60448341,2016-01-24,31096159,Andrew,Our visit to Capetown was perfect.  The transportation Chris arranged to pick us up at the airport was waiting for us.  It was unusually hot in Capetown during our stay  but that didn't change how great the house was.  The pool  the laundry  the 3 bedrooms  the full kitchen  the coffeefruit that was left for us.  It was exactly as described.  It is close to the grocery store and some great restaurants and bars.   Chris had left cell phones that we could activate if needed and was available for any questions we had.  The Wi-Fi was fast and reliable as well.  You need to stay here if you are visiting Capetown
782208,61385403,2016-02-03,53596300,Karin,If you are looking for a 5 star experience in Cape Town  don't look further but book with Chris and Jenny From a complimentary pick up from the airport to their exquisite home  it is perfect Beautifully comfortable beds  huge  fluffy towels  reading lights next to your bed  fully equipped kitchen down to salt and pepper  tea  coffee  crisps  cling wrap etc. It is all waiting for you So is the pristine pool which deserves its name as you can swim in it - compared to other properties which claim to have a pool which turns out to be the size of a teacup once you are there. Chris is most efficient helping you with restaurants  itineraries  any feedback you need  you get a very prompt and kind response. We will be back
782208,62155496,2016-02-12,49918773,Lucy,Excellent host  beautiful apartment  great location.
782208,62736471,2016-02-16,1367898,Dee,We received a very gracious welcome by Natasha who picked us up from the airport and Chris who met us at the house. With the fridge stocked with basics  a full fruit bowl  and a gorgeous house  we felt immediately at home and jumped into the pool The location was perfect with nearby conveniences and activities while Uber was always available and quick to pick us up for outings further afield. The best Airbnb property we've chosen yet  previously in Australia  Portugal  Spain  Singapore.
782208,63966762,2016-02-28,29717434,Pauline,The house was absolutely gorgeous. It is very spacious  the lounge opens up to a very big patio and onto the garden with a great swimming pool. The house has everything that you need  from toiletries to even a generous fruit bowl. It is a beautiful place  and definitely a five star experience. Chris was very accommodating and flexible. The location is great  can easily walk up to restaurants and shops  the promenade in Green Point  the Waterfront  Waterkant and Cape Town CBD. Overall it was a privilege to be there
782208,65827999,2016-03-17,11052521,Zoe,It's easy to see why Chris is a super host and he further still blew our expectations out of the water.  He went above and beyond to to ensure we enjoyed our time in his home and Capetown.  The home is just as it pictured and the neighborhood is equally as scenic and safe. Amazing home  amazing host.

782208,66689897,2016-03-24,1243151,Adam,Had an absolutely fantastic time in Chris's wonderful home Pictures don't do the house justice. The pool and outdoor patio are a real treat  bedrooms are spacious and well kept  and if you're a fan of cooking  the kitchen will not disappoint. We didn't run into any problems during our stay  but Chris was always available and accommodating to any of our needs. The house is in a perfect location  as it is a stones throw away from the hustle and bustle of CBD  but just around the corner from some of Green Point's nicest cafes and restaurants. I have nothing but positive things to stay about our stay in Chris's home and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to spend some time in beautiful Cape Town
782208,79868226,2016-06-14,6662337,Jayne,Although I travel quite a bit  this was my first time using Airbnb. I thought the required Airbnb verification process was tedious but after meeting Chris  our host  and seeing the house rental  it was all worth it. Chris is a wonderful host. His thoughtfulness is apparent from the start with the airport pick up by Natasha who is great and continues throughout the stay. He even provides a cell phone for direct contact during your stay. He was very responsive and really made us feel at home. The house was like an oasis in a busy city with quick Ubercab pickup and several very good restaurants within walking distance e.g.  NU health food restaurant with great breakfast  Shego Turkish and Gold traditional African. The home is spacious and the outdoor space in the backyard is beautiful. All in all  the rental is even better in person than in the pictures. I highly recommend renting from Chris and would do it again in a heart beat.
782208,83653654,2016-07-03,5037913,Rahul,A great spot to spend a few days or weeks in Cape Town. It was close to all the things we wanted to explore. Chris is a fantastic host. He knows the city well and went out of his way to make us feel welcomed. Always had a suggestion and was extremely easy to communicate with. The house itself is very nice. An oasis in the middle of the city.
782208,93212429,2016-08-11,70369736,Susan,The house is beautiful - exactly as described with little extras such as milk and food awaiting us when we arrived. The Woolworths store a few minutes walk away makes it easy to buy provisions.  Chris did everything to make our stay easy and enjoyable
782208,101763933,2016-09-15,43602767,Dirk,We absolutely loved our stay at this gorgeous house The house has an amazing location and was as beautiful as on the pictures. Chris is an absolute fabulous host. Most definitely recommend
782208,104889587,2016-09-29,63005532,Andrew,I'd recommend this house to anyone. It perfectly suited our large group 8 people and we never felt on top of each  other  as it has great  large indoor and outdoor living areas. We spent most of our time lazing around outside  on the spacious grassed area and the pool.
287211,25074604,2015-01-06,2092064,Eileen,We had a lovely bowl of fruit with some little Christmas chocolates left out for us  as well as being allowed to take any salad and herbs out of the garden.

287211,29403726,2015-04-07,27891929,Chris,Fiona's house is in an extremely central and convenient location in Cape Town  and well suited to our needs. It was also nice to have a few amenities  such as milk and fruit upon arrival.

287211,1062156005539468613,2024-01-05,209200416,Leon,Thank you Fiona we had a lovely stay but there should be a microwave oven in kitchen. Fortunately we ate at the house only once. The waste pipe for the washing machine was also not inserted in the outlet pipe. We should have been made aware of the dishwasher and washing machine waste pipes needing to be switched over depending on usage. We lost a lot of food when the fridge failed but fortunately it was replaced within a few days
287211,1147727811456707348,2024-05-02,28497592,Emilie,La maison de Fiona est charmante et trs bien place.  Accs rapide  Table montain et au centre ville.  La maison est trs confortable   propre et bien quipe   c'tait parfait pour notre famille de 5. Merci Fiona
782208,108326577,2016-10-15,34833404,Tony,The house and location was excellent. Both Chris and Jenny made us feel welcome. They arranged transport from the airport and also give recommendations on where to eat. Everywhere they recommended was fantastic. They were considerate and left food in the kitchen and fridge for our arrival. If we as a family ever return to Cape Town  then this is the place I would stay.
782208,109574017,2016-10-22,91740375,Luan Felipe,magnificent house. great place. ample space. wonderful pool. large rooms and great bathrooms. residence with easy access to any part of cape town.

782208,123211730,2016-12-28,20861671,Sarah,We spent 5 nights at Chris' place in Cape Town. A grown family this house was perfect with space for everyone including bathrooms each. The house is in great proximity to everything in Cape Town. Easy walking distance to the waterfront and downtown areas and a cheap uber to the beaches or anything else further. Chris put us in touch with an excellent tour guide who took us out to the Peninsula for a day and shark cage diving. Highly recommended for a trip to Cape Town for those who like to do their own thing.
782208,126582197,2017-01-13,39425465,Laura,Exceptionnelle   Sublime ... Un petit paradis   un accueil excellent   Chris est d'une gentillesse et disponible  chaque instant .

Always ready to look out for our needs and provide valuable information and tips on everything from eating out to must see attractions.

782208,128882355,2017-01-28,76114864,Stephen,Chris and the house couldn't have been better. Description and pictures simply don't do the place justice. Fantastic from start to finish.
291205,8783519,2013-11-18,8684024,Monika,Hanne und Werner waren wirklich vorbildliche  freundliche und offene Gastgeber. Die Wohnung war gro  hell und gemtlich eingerichtet und lie es an nichts fehlen. Wir haben es genossen abends auf unserer eigenen Terrasse zu sitzen und ihre beiden Hunde waren herzlich gerne bei uns willkommen. Es hat uns trotz der 2 Tage Dauerregens so gut gefallen  dass wir schon heute neue Reiseplne schmieden.
291205,12500358,2014-05-04,13782719,Harco,The accommodation provided bij Hanne and Warner is perfectly situated and in a nice neighbourhood near supermarket and cinema. Perfect drive to waterfront through Constantine area and Camps Bay. We love dogs but one thing we did not like was de dogs barking in the morning in front of bedroom situated front side and the car leaving early too. The dogs are fun and they probably give a lot of security. I would highly recommend Hanne if they keep the dogs away from the bedroom window. Big open and fully equipped kitchen with dishwasher  Good shower too. Braai in the garden. What more does one want Thank you
291205,24004061,2014-12-16,23185703,Holger,3 wunderschne bernachtungen mit meinen drei Kindern liegen hinter uns. Wir haben ein sehr schn eingerichtetes Apartement vorgefunden. Die Kche war perfekt eingerichtet. Der Hit fr meine Kinder war der Pool. Herzlichen Dank 
291205,24142735,2014-12-21,17214588,Lisa,Hanne was a wonderful host and made us feel very welcome.  The flat was perfect in every way with great facilities  excellent location  and safety.  Many thanks Hanne for your kind hospitality. Lisa and Dave
291205,33753790,2015-05-31,29668473,Julie,Hanne and her husband were wonderful hosts. They were friendly and helpful and the apartment was immaculate. We enjoyed our stay so much and will use this apartment in the future.
291205,92908543,2016-08-10,57420179,Bio Bijou,Hanne and Werner are both very friendly  welcoming and helpful hosts. The house is situated in a quiet and secure neighbourhood close to shopping  medics and all major roads. The house itself is very clean and spacious and is fully equipped  as well as the garden being beautifully maintained. Our 2 year old had plenty of space to run around and play and you are quaranteed privacy during your stay. The dogs  Sambucca and Amy  are well behaved and will give you a warm greeting when you arrive home. All in all we had a very pleasant stay.
291205,223298233,2018-01-01,99993952,Kirsten,Awesome hosts  great location and wonderful accommodation

291205,531610531129134434,2022-01-03,4593050,Donna,This lovely  spacious 1-bedroom spot was a godsend for us.  I have a 2 year-old toddler and there was ample space for us.  A big lounge  separate kitchen and dining space and the lovely garden outside area was perfect for Luke to run around in.     Communication and check-in with Hanne was easy.   And while the flatlet is right next door to Hanne's house  we felt very private.   Thank you Hanne  you may see us again soon.
291205,556302360898898524,2022-02-06,429797115,Marco,Great place to stay  extremely well equipped and comfortable. Hanne and Werner are great hosts and provide a super place to stay. Will be back again

291205,796952458298941100,2023-01-04,6987868,Marcel,Die Wohnung von Hanne und Werner war genau wie beschreiben. Wir hatten eine sehr schne Zeit dort mit unseren Kindern und wrden sicher beim nchsten mal wiederkommen. Wir wurden sehr positiv berrascht als wir schon in die Wohnung konnten  obwohl wir eigentlich nur vereinbart hatten  dass wir die Koffer abgeben und spter am Tag einchecken.
291205,820158619954803083,2023-02-05,12755283,Linda,We had a lovely stay at Hannes Seven Sleepers airbnb.  We were there almost a month and everything was wonderful.  The neighborhood is in such a great area  you can walk to the mall and restaurants.  Hanne was a very responsive and helpful host.  We loved the private garden in the back to relax in.  We would love to stay with Hanne again in the future
291205,845446304616581663,2023-03-12,66240303,Nuria,Excelente Lugar tranquilo y seguro. Casa muy confortable bien equipada. Estuvimos muy a gusto. Gracias Hanne por la amabilidad Repetiramos.

291205,1040476449685995151,2023-12-06,143131282,Margarette,We loved our stay at Hannes place. We stayed for 8 days. It was clean  neat  well equipped  safe  quiet and well situated being near the shopping mall and gives easy access to the lovely Cape Town beach. Hannes place had a lovely back garden and we could use the pool if we wished. Hanne was always available if we needed anything and was very kind and helpful. We would definitely stay again if we come back to SA and would recommend Hanne place to others. Thank you Hanne and Werne for having us.
291205,1136166548154278506,2024-04-16,42815926,Nigel,Very quiet and comfortable.
292170,27144490,2015-02-26,27211679,Betsy,Sandra is a constant ray of sunshine She welcomed me in to her and her lovely doggies home on short notice with an open heart and a delicious plate of food. I never once felt unsafe or uncomfortable in the home or in the surrounding area. I am very excited that I am still in Cape Town and will be able to see her often
782208,130050653,2017-02-04,70631776,Omer,We spent 7 nights in Cape Town  Chris's house was one of the main highlights of the trip  the house was beautiful and comfy  the location was really helpful close to all the main attractions of Cape Town.
782208,132484098,2017-02-18,22776376,C,A great home for family or group of 3 or 4 couples. Very nicely located within approx 15 min walk to VA and Green Market.  Lots of restaraunts and shopping close by. Uber worked great if you don't like to walk. House has alot of indoor and outdoor space.
292170,28357779,2015-03-22,28697327,Barry,Sandra is a fantastic host Her house is very homely. Clean and tidy. Excellent private shower room. Good transport links and local shops. Beautiful gardens. Her dogs are very friendly and well behaved. A warm and quirky host who makes you feel at home very quickly. Overall I'd recommend her 100 Feels like your staying with a life long family friend not in a 'bed  breakfast'. I will defo stay with her when I return to Cape Town.
292170,526607820735121242,2021-12-27,58747193,Ava,Sandys home is AMAZING. Her artwork in her home is phenomenal  everything when you arrive is clean and tidy  and she even puts out tea and snacks for you My stay here will be remembered forever. She is so accommodating to everything you need. She knows everyone in her neighborhood and can give you keen advice on the best things to see and do around town. I am so lucky that Sandy crossed my path  and I would encourage anyone thats interested in staying at her home to try it out.
292170,762836463347266397,2022-11-18,51653490,Carl,Eclectic house with a one of a kind hostess. Sandra is sweet and friendly and makes extra effort to help her guests feel at home and welcome. Need something She's got it and knows exactly where to find it. Would stay again when I return to glorious CT
298622,7375265,2013-09-17,8992084,Jenny,I had a fantastic stay in Simon's Town. The apartment was equipped with everything one might need and more  the view was even more spectacular than described and Diane and Peter were model hosts. I only wish I could have stayed for longer
298622,7831949,2013-10-05,8526498,Sara,Beautiful place much nicer than photos even. Diane and Peter lovely hosts really good to chat to people about their history and that of SA. So handy for boulders beach and the penguins lovely beach walks and Cape of Good Hope. Very comfortable bed nice local places to eat. Would love to come again
298622,8608455,2013-11-08,6427372,Micah,Excellent experience. Diane is an excellent host and the house is great. It has great views and it's very well furnished. Would definitely recommend without any reservations.
298622,9734278,2014-01-07,9188715,Annelies,The most beautiful views and lovely hosts. We felt most welcome and there were good facilities for our 3-year old. I will definitely go back if I am in the area again.
298622,10061184,2014-01-28,922463,Kristen,What can I say This place was truly amazing The views of False Bay are awesome The apartment itself was clean  bed very comfortable  the kitchen had everything you needed  the pool was great  beach was the best  and the trampoline was just fun. Worth every penny. I would highly recommend Diane's wonderful home. Thanks for everything
298622,10344455,2014-02-15,9873914,Andre,I chose to stay at Diane and Peter's place while visiting Simons Town for two weeks. For my wife and myself it was an ideal location  offering spectacular views over False Bay   close enough proximity to ST as well as CT  and other popular tourist attractions on the cape. Above all else however  it was very quiet and peaceful. Diane and Peter and Mr Darcy were exceptional hosts and I would recommend their place to anyone wanting to stay near Cape Town.. NB a car is a must  but you get a space in the garage..  
298622,10584701,2014-02-26,4572153,Olivier,We found heaven and it's in Simon Town  a convenient 45-minute drive south of Cape Town. Diane and Peter's own a piece of  this delicious coastal town whose shores are inhabited by gracious sea creatures from penguins  to dolphins  to seals and whales. Their house's top floor apartment offers full accomodations on top of truly stunning east-facing views on the ocean that include ravishing sun rises that will take your breath away.  Diane and Peter are the most delightful hosts whose abundant knowledge of the local culture will improve your stay ten-fold. The gorgeous garden and lovely pool complete this perfect picture to make it completely impossible not to have a wonderful vacation. There's a charming beach  favored by locals  within walking distance and the town doesn't let shoppers down with its over a dozen quaint shops. Let's not forget to mention that their sweet 11-year-old pet dog Mr. D'Arcy is a true gentleman.
782208,139687228,2017-03-26,95518342,Wendy,Lovely home. We had a few issues which we have discussed with the owner and we are sure he will correct these as he is very ammenable.
298622,10622440,2014-02-28,10517852,Shanna,Diane was so lovely - she took her time to explain everything to us and was always on hand if needed.  She was very accommodating when I asked for a very late check out with hardly any notice and managed to rearrange the cleaning to accommodate us.  This was very appreciated as we landed up having a fabulous last day thanks to Diane.  We had a 2 year old and a 4 year old with us and the apartment was perfect for this - Diane even has a stair gate and toys and the trampoline and pool heated were much enjoyed.  The views from the apartment are amazing.  Very highly recommended.
298622,11425198,2014-04-02,7405280,Wayne,After having just come from a 30 trucktenting safari for our Canadian family of 4 Diane's space was the PERFECT place for us.  Super clean  open with wonderful views of the ocean. it was exactly what my family needed 2 children 14 and 12 who did share the open bedroom concept of the living room.  We had been on the road for almost 4 months on our round the world trip and needed a nice break.  Diane and Peter were both super pleasant and helpful and we greatly appreciate that.  We are walkers but it is suggested that one rent's a vehicle here as everything is outside walking distance groceries  sites etc.  Cape Point  hiking Table Mountain  Chapman's Peak road  Robben Island and Langa Township Tour were highlights of our 2 week stay.  Our stay was a 10 out of 10 and we will have fond memories for a lifetime.  Thank you Diane and Peter.  Would recommend Andre to pu from the airport.  He is their neighbour and gave us a wonderfulinsightful ride to Diane's place pointing out all the sites and even dropping us off at Long Beach Mall to stock up on groceries.
298622,17758463,2014-08-17,16879756,Rosie,Fabulous apartment  beautifully furnished  with fantastic views.  Diane and Peter were very helpful and accommodating.  They made sure we had everything we needed  assisted us with recommendations for everything from shopping  groceries  sightseeing to travel times.  We could not have asked for better hosts.  The apartment is in a quiet residential area of Simon's Town overlooking the bay.  Easy walk to the beach and down to the penguins.  Perfect central location for touring and enjoying the Cape.  Thank you Diane and Peter.
298622,19294782,2014-09-09,14940752,Greg,Our stay at Diane  Peter's loft in Simon's Town was a highlight of our trip to South Africa The views are even more stunning than what you see in the photos  and the location is close enough to town to find meals and basic supplies while just far enough out to make you feel like you've found a secret passage to the uninhabited end of the earth. Diane and Peter were extremely warm and welcoming when we arrived but respectful of our space and privacy - we felt we had the entire house to ourselves. We'd highly recommend more than just two nights
298622,21007830,2014-10-09,21713594,Sarah,The photos do not do this apartment's view justice...it really is beautiful The apartment was well equipped and our host was very kind We have decided there's nothing one could change about the location of this apartment to make it any better mountain behind  beach in front and sea forever Thank you for sharing it Peter and Diane
782208,140338591,2017-03-29,98210703,Andre,Perfect place to visit CapeTown  very friendly host and a superb house. We come again
782208,144253230,2017-04-15,24387210,Andrea,Great place to stay. Beautiful home  well equipped with everything we needed. Chris was a wonderful host. Very reachable and accommodating. He left very clear instructions and a range of resources to help us make the most of our trip. We would definitely stay here again
782208,152935227,2017-05-19,34088471,Anna,What a lovely stay The house is beautiful and spacious  each member of our party was able to have their own bedroom and bathroom- a real game changer The outside area is delightful  perfect for a glass of wine and a book Chris was more than helpful and so responsive to any questions we had. A truly wonderful stay
782208,158897457,2017-06-09,72208124,Vishpala,Beautifully done up house  great amenities and walking distance from VA waterfront We were stuck in the house due to the storm and hence managed to enjoy the space. Chris was really helpful and pickup from the airport was really helpful. Wish we had some more time in Capetown
782208,163245756,2017-06-24,33069436,Julie,This house is more beautiful in person than pictures would suggest.  We had a wonderful time and your house is amazing  Great location  wonderful amenities  and personal service
782208,164628579,2017-06-28,46333606,Kristi,Such a beautiful home to spend 4 days in Cape Town Restaurants and shops very close made it even more convenient. Chris was very helpful  hospitable  and accommodating. I would recommend this beautiful home to anyone
782208,166269328,2017-07-03,89405077,Lindsay,The house is very well situated around 12 minutes walk from the VA. There are also restaurants and shops within walking distance. In Winter late June we did find the house to be chilly as there is no central air in South Africa. The duvet on the bed was quite thin for the temperature. Not an issue for 10 of the 12 months I'm sure We all loved Cape Town and want to go back. Unfortunately we only had 3 nights at the house. I would book the house again.
782208,169130829,2017-07-11,1135126,Kathryn,Chris' home is fully equipped with everything you need and is a great base for your to explore Cape Town. We had a large group of 9 friends and the house was the ideal size and set up  with each bedroom having its own en suite bathroom. The living and dining rooms were big enough for our entire group to hang out together and there's a lovely backyard and back deck. It's within walking distance to many restaurants  a grocery store and tourist sites like the VA Waterfront. Farther sites are easily accessible with Uber. Chris was a wonderful host  giving us with many recommendations and even helping us coordinate a surprise birthday dinner complete with private chef for two in our group who were celebrating birthdays during our trip. He was very communicative and very knowledgeable about area attractions  restaurants and bars. We would not hesitate to stay at the Wessels House again. Thank you  Chris
782208,190080815,2017-09-03,26752910,Tim,We wholeheartedly recommend Chris' house as a place to stay in Cape Town. The location was great for us  being within walking distance of the Convention Centre and also the attractions at the Waterfront and Green Point. The house is amazing and was much loved by both the adults and kids in our group. We rented the Studio as well as the main house which was perfect for the grandparents. Chris also went out of his way to help us  from discussing local hiking routes to refilling the gas promptly on the BBQ. This really was the perfect place for us to stay in Cape Town
298622,21953869,2014-10-27,13369928,Nadia,Diane nous a chaleureusement accueillis  avec simplicit et gentillesse. L'appartement correspond exactement aux photos
298622,23030127,2014-11-21,17213122,Flora,We really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful apartment  which looked just like on the photos  only the views were even better... Its not possible to do justice to the stunning ocean views with mountains beyond that we woke up to every day. We brought our 3 year-old daughter with us for two weeks here and she had a great time with the trampoline and pool  and playing with the little friendly dog. We used the barbeque several times and Diane really did everything to make us comfortable here  though we actually had the garden to ourselves most of the time since she is also a busy person. The place felt really very private  windows were all sheltered so people didn't see you from outside. We made some lovely excursions to Cape Point  the ostrich farm  World of Birds and Kirstenbosh botanical gardens  all which are conviniently located from Simon's town Cape town is however quite far  for a day trip it's fine  but don't plan on staying here if you want to go to Cape Town a lot. The penguins at Boulders were a nice short walk away and made a good little excursion on several occasions. The place is lovely  though the weather can be quite windy on the penninsula in springtime  which was the only drawback for us here  as it is difficult to do much outdoors when it is blowing very hard.
782208,191423986,2017-09-07,115759939,Rick,Wonderful home Great service Absolutely spectacular
782208,194534295,2017-09-17,44503526,Jennifer,Chris was very helpful and responsive during the booking process.  Sharyn the property manager was also very accommodating during the arrival process.

782208,199478687,2017-10-02,9165597,Vera,The property is beautiful  in an excellent location. Communication with the property owner and with the property manager was prompt and easy. I would highly recommend this property to anybody.
782208,200638159,2017-10-06,146764774,Marco Salvatore,Casa molto bella in posizione centrale dove  facile raggiungere il waterfront anche a piedi. Ad ogni modo una macchina sar sempre necessaria per vedere tutto quello che Cape Town e dintorni offre. Livello di pulizia molto alto e casa fornita di tutti i comfort  forse anche del superfluo. Abbiamo avuto qualche problema con la doccia nel bagno della main bedroom ed al piano interrato dove qualche inaspettata  visita notturna ha svegliato i miei amici che dormivano. Sono sicuro che Chris avr modo di rimediare a questi piccoli problemi. Considerato tutto una casa da prendere al volo.
782208,205174881,2017-10-21,8670770,Kelsey,Chris' place really is as beautiful as it looks in the pictures we were greeted with Ferror Roche on our pillows  toiletries in the bathroom and a complimentary airport pick up. Sharyn and Chris were both extremely responsive and friendly  their resource books were great for us to figure out where to gowhat to do in CT.  Would highly recommend staying here - great value for money
782208,212077078,2017-11-16,57495797,John,Well located  and a great house in which to stay for a large family or group. The arrangements for our stay were very well managed by Sharyn  Chris's House manager.

298622,23298451,2014-11-28,21507657,Paolo,Diane and Peter have been great hosts. The apartment has magnificent views on False Bay. It is in a perfect location to visit Cape Point with its open spaces and pristine landscape. Convenient food stores at less than 10 minute drive. The apartment is clean and has everything necessary for a stay  whether short or long. A wonderfully quiet place to relax or work.
782208,215497386,2017-11-30,100041130,Heidi,It was a nice place  very good located. The outside area was perfekt for the whole family to enjoy the nice weather and relaxing at the big pool. We will come back in the future.
782208,216723932,2017-12-05,2142142,Mitya,Wessels House is a great choice if you want to be in the heart of Cape Town but feel very safe. We were a party of 5 adults and two children. It's a pleasant 10 - 15 min walk to the VA Waterfront  where you can catch the Hop onHop off bus  get taxis  etc. We were also able to book Uber from the house without any issues using our own accounts. The facilities are great  and it was super helpful to have the basics such as bread and milk stocked for our arrival. There's a coffee machine  toaster  BBQs  kettle  dishwasher etc. The pool is fenced which is perfect if you have children  and the garden is a really good size. There's a Woolworths food shop 5 mins away which had everything we needed for our stay. Would definitely recommend the place to families and groups.
782208,218125580,2017-12-11,137438554,Warren,Beautiful home in a great location which is central to most attractions in the city and the hosts were a pleasure to deal with.

782208,226927606,2018-01-13,49071407,Gary,14 Wessels is a quiet haven in the midst of Cape Town. Despite its position it is very quiet and private  making it a perfect place to stay. The 4 bedrooms are well appointed  each with its own en suite so works well with a large family. And the fresh bread and condiments were a surprise and much appreciated. Finally  all questions were very promptly answered. Thank you.
782208,232521318,2018-02-05,140412332,Katina,Great location A very warm welcome from Chris who was always there to help when needed.
782208,238566540,2018-02-26,24300714,Ontario,Chris' home is a welcome  stylish space in Central Green Point  close to the Waterfront and proximate to grocery stores and restaurants. As we visited during the current drought  Chris was in contact to explain the best ways to save water. Despite the drought  the pool was available  which was great for our group  as we had two children 2 and 4 that thoroughly enjoyed the space. Chris' home was well stocked with everything a visitor could want  including an impressive wine selection  electrical converters and all of the little things that one might forget. We loved our time in Cape Town and Chris helped make the trip great.
782208,242534061,2018-03-12,8324613,Kerstin,Wessels House is a very rare find in Green Point - such a big property and hence lots of space PLUS excellent water saving features. We found everything we needed and loved that it was in walking distance of shops  the stadium etc. Chris is an awesome host and his communication impeccable. We traveled with two small kids for whom he provided camp cots so very accommodating and friendly.
782208,247652669,2018-03-29,26487819,Andy,This place is great Very accommodating and a great location Chris is very helpful and was easy to work with. Highly recommend staying at this place for any large groups

Die Wohnung ist sehr schn geschnitten und geschmackvoll eingerichtet  man hat alles was man braucht. Die Kinder 4 und 2 Jahre haben den Garten sehr genossen  insb Trampolin  Klettergerst und Pool. Unbedingt fr Familien zu empfehlen auch fr Nicht-Familien. Herrliche Aussicht auf die Bucht  absolut ruhig.
298622,24517602,2014-12-30,12505581,Anna,Astonishing view and very lovely hosts. We really enjoyed our days both in the apartment  by the pool  at the beach and travelling around. Diane and Peter are pointed out as superhosts and we really agree to that
298622,25075437,2015-01-06,16892856,Marc,Un joli logement au dessus de celui des propritaires avec une superbe vue. Tout confort. Nous tions avec 2 enfants et ils ont aussi bien profit de la piscine et du trampoline. Diane et son mari sont trs accueillants et trs sympathiques. Emplacement trs sr et idal pour partir voir les pingouins  pied. Bons restos pas loin. Bref que du positif.
298622,26291605,2015-02-09,20197279,Hans,Boendet r helt suvernt med en underbar versikt ver False Bay. Lgenheten r mycket vlplanerad och innehller allt man behver  med en massa omtnksamma detaljer  som kylvska och klampar  solskydd till bilen och en massa guidebcker om Sydafrika och regionen.  Lget r helt perfekt mitt emellan Kapstaden och Godahoppsudden och utgr en utmrkt bas fr utfrder i det vackra grannskapet. Poolen  som man nstan disponerar fr eget bruk  r en riktig hjdare  inbddad i grnska och skyddad frn vind.  Om man hellre vill bada i det turkosa havet r det bara en fem minuters promenad nerfr backen. Att sitta p den hrliga balkongen och njuta av kvllssolen och kunna se stim av delfiner komma hoppande i havet r minnen fr livet. Vrdparet  Diane  Peter  r charmerande och gr allt fr att vistelsen ska bli s bra som mjligt. Vi spenderade flera kvllar i deras sllskap fr att prata och dricka vin  medan solen gick ner. Vi tyckte att vi tog till nr vi bokade fyra veckor  men inser nu att det var alldeles fr lite.
298622,26443602,2015-02-13,13303599,Karolina,Everything was just wonderful The apartment was perfect with an amazing view. Dianne and her husband was so helping and friendly. It was so nice to take a walk and meet the penguins at the beach. I would recommend this place to everyone.
298622,27131335,2015-02-26,18988971,Patrick,Diana and her Husband Peter are really great hosts. The room and the view is amazing. We stayed 3 Nights and we enjoyed it. Thanks for everything
298622,28881774,2015-03-31,21932500,Kilian,The apartment is unbelievably beautiful  the view from the living room and balcony just breathtaking Diane is a wonderful host We spent great days in the cape area and would love to stay there again -  better sooner than later
298622,33347932,2015-05-27,11152819,Lauren,This place was even more beautiful than the photos Seriously  the views of the beach are phenomenal. This was by far the best airbnb experience I have had yet. It was a perfect location. We rented a car  and had a great time driving up the coast to muizenberg and kalk bay and down the coast to cape point and of course  across the street to see the Penguins There was garage parking for us. Diane was an amazing host  even helping us with lanterns during a blackout  and lending us a movie for a night in. There was also more than enough space for the three of us. We could have fit one more It was too  cold for the pool  but would have been an exciting amenity with warmer weather
298622,34350691,2015-06-07,4586703,Jill,Diane and Peter's flat is as described  up on a hillside looking down over beautiful False Bay and the surrounding mountains  with a safe bathing beach immediately below or a swimming pool if you prefer. The flat is light  bright  and comfortable with every amenity on hand. The neighborhood feels safe and it's an easy walk into town. We were warmly welcomed on arrival. This was my second visit and I would go again and highly recommend this AirBnB.
298622,51525425,2015-10-21,31905726,Diane,Diane and Peter were exceptional hosts  inviting us into their home for conversation and snacks during our first full day in Simonstown. Their superb apartment overlooking False Bay is like a home away from home with an incredible view of the bay from every window  The pictures are exactly how you will find it  The apartment was very clean and Diane even stocked the refrigerator with essentials at our request since our flight arrived late at night and then took us shopping for a few more items we needed during our first day in town since we didn't have a car or driver that day.  Diane also offered to let us use their laundry washing machine  which we did not find necessary  but the offer was very kind if we had stayed longer.  The apartment does have a drying rack for hand laundry and the breezes off the bay will dry your things quickly.  At our request  Diane also arranged for a driver to meet us at the airport and bring us to the apartment. This turned out to be a wonderful situation with a local tour guide who offered to take us on a private tour all over Cape Town and surrounding area during the days were were there for a reasonable price.  The guide Diane arranged was knowledgeable  accommodating  and very helpful.  He made sure he stayed apprised of local traffic conditions to avoid congestion to make the most of our time in Cape Town. As a local  he had a lot of wonderful insight into many things in Cape Town that were added local color and personal history.  In comparing notes from others who had visited Cape Town  we saw more things that the tour buses in a short amount of time.   Diane and Peter are delightful  knowledgeable people and we would love to return to their stunning sea view apartment as soon as possible  Situated close to Simonstown and Boulder Beach  you can see wild penguins on the beach -- a totally fantastic experience one could repeat daily. The beach is a safe swimming area for families and children.  Diane and Peter also have a pool and garden to enjoy.  And they have a trampoline and toys for little ones. If our itinerary would have allowed we wished we could have stayed longer Will be recommending this place and host to all my friends and family  Although we didn't see it  Diane and Peter have another small apartment on site so that a family could take both apartments if more space was needed. Thank you Diane and Peter for a wonderful holiday at your place  We feel like we have new friends in South Africa  Best wishes to you
298622,52670460,2015-11-01,25933625,Birgit,A big apartment with an amazing view. We get a warm welcome from Paul.  We spent 2 nights in the apartment  far too short. Simons Town is perfect situated for a trip to  the Cape of Good Hope.

It is a short  2 minute   steep walk up from the main street where there are shops  and everything you may need. We were a family of 6  and we stayed for a week. The house is spacious  and can easily accommodate also a group of 8. Chris is a very friendly and really helpful host. He went out of his way for us to have a great stay at Cape Town. I highly recommend staying at his house

They are both very kind and welcoming and they make it very easy to feel comfortable and at home  in the garden  around the pool  in the house And in it you will find everything you need. The kitchen is just perfectly equipped even a garlic press was there which makes it clear It is not a normal airbnb-kitchen but a real kitchen you would be happy to have at home  Diane offered a bed  high-chair  toys for our son  bathroom perfect as well. And we also liked the neighbourhood a lot. Not so much tourists  lovely beach to go for a walk  very safe

357793,2629156,2012-10-16,3167329,Selene,We absolutely loved staying here for 3 nights on our honeymoon.  The location is very central in Capetown  in a very safe apartment building with private parking.  The apartment itself is beautiful.  It has a gorgeous balcony with incredible views of Lions Head and Table Mountain.  The upstairs room has one of the best tubs I've ever seen- it's HUGE and it is IN the bedroom.  There were only 2 of us  but this would be a great apartment for a family with one or two children- the upstairs room is perfect for parents and the downstairs room has 2 beds.  There are actually 4 separate beds the upstairs room has two pushed together and a couch  so it could sleep 5 or 6.  The Wifi is fast  although not free.  Gaining access to the property was easy with the instructions given by Mike and Lilliane and they were very available  checking in with us via text to ensure we were situated and comfortable.  There's a huge book with advice about activities.  The location is so great that you can park the car at the apartment and walk the city center.  Some Capetownians said that the area was dangerous at night but we didn't observe that at ALL- and we went out for dinner and walked to and from Long Street and we never felt unsafe.  We thought it couldn't get any better than the hotel room we booked on our first night in Capetown  but this apartment was even more beautiful than our fancy hotel.
357793,2783342,2012-11-02,2026608,Linda And Oscar,One word would describe Mike and Liliane's apartment in Cape Town WOW  The view across the Company Gardens to Table Mountain is worth the stay  even if you never left the balcony.  Yet  the location is so easy to access especially with the covered gargage that comes with the unit  to walk to museums  take a taxi to the VA Waterfront  Artscape  restaurants  and shopping.  Day trips to the Peninsual  Kirstenbosch  and wine country are easy from the M3  M2  just a few blocks away.  Liliane and Mike kept in touch with us prior to our trip  and even upon arrival.

782208,443967098,2019-04-27,21804777,Cecilia,This is the best place ever It is like coming to a hotel since Chris support special made soap  shampoo and lotion. The house is amazing and we havent had any troubles at all and the kids loved it too. It is close to waterfront and a lot of restaurants nearby.

357793,6320771,2013-08-08,6499531,Michele,We stayed at Mike and Liliane's City Chic apartment in early August 2013. The apartment was immaculate  very well equipped with everything you need  extremely comfortable and very secure. The location is excellent and within walking distance to shops  restaurants  supermarkets etc. The view of Table Mountain  Lions Head and the city below is breathtaking The information received prior to staying at the apartment was very informative and helpful. On the first evening we had a problem with the TV and contacted the owners. Mike happened to be in Cape Town at the time and personally came to sort it out for us Would definitely recommend this apartment.
782208,483225056,2019-07-07,486016,Vivien,A stylish house in a well positioned central location. The host was easy to reach and friendly. Would definitely recommend.
782208,513822541,2019-08-20,267646073,Saad,Great location  four en-suite rooms  beautiful garden.
782208,519225445,2019-08-28,149570839,Kathleen,Chris is awesome He was not only our host but our tour guide for our time in Cape Town. He recommended everything from Shark Diving operators to Wine Tasting guides and all his recommendations were top notch The house is beautiful and very well situated to all the attractions. 5 stars across the board
782208,529864354,2019-09-15,94569461,Hilary,The house is as pictured. The beds are super comfortable  We were a party of seven and had plenty of space to spread out.  The terrace is lovely  Very close to many activities in the downtown area.  The street is on a sharp incline so hold onto your luggage when loading and   Chris couldnt have been more helpful  If you dont feel like walking everywhere Uber is very inexpensive
782208,535335768,2019-09-24,6796230,Ishan,Chris place is great for a family stay - we had a super time. Very comfortable and spacious house - lots of great local tips in the house booklet  we thoroughly enjoyed the space and had a memorable stay
357793,6459962,2013-08-13,1365495,Skye,A wonderful stay A beautiful well located apartment. Liliane is extremely helpful and provides great information about the city. Only issue was I was there on business with a colleague but only one person at a time could use the wifi which took some coordinating. But a very minor detail considering all the other amazing amenities the apartment offered. Will definitely come back when I'm in Cape Town again. Thank you
357793,7432649,2013-09-20,7150948,Kara,Perfect location We were so close to everything. Wod highly recommend to anyone visiting the city.
357793,8166500,2013-10-19,2418855,Julie,The place was spectacular  Great location close to long street so you can go out at night and get back safe.  Plus as you see an amazing view  There was a doorman 247 which helped us feel super safe.  The only reason not to give 5 stars is that you can hear everything from everywhere in the aptartment.  Which is an issue with sleeping and waking only.  Make sure you are all on the same page with sleep scheds or bring ear plugs and you will be good to go.  Also Liliane was very responsive via emails etc 
357793,8458034,2013-11-01,6262367,Julianne,Mike and Liliane were very helpful and accessable guests.  The apartment is exactly as expected.  Great bed linens  beds and showers.

357793,13614113,2014-06-01,6277200,Andy,We have just returned from Cape Town and had the most amazing time..A huge contributing factor to this was this amazing apartment that we stayed in....the pictures really don't do it justice.. It was surreal that on the morning we were having breakfast alfresco taking in an awesome view of Table Mountain that two hours later we would be on the top viewing the breath taking scenery . Everything went smoothly with the booking and communications. The information about the apartment  parking  key code  internet connection  things to do was very comprehensive and easy to understand. Mike and Liliane really have everything covered.. We can't wait to revisit this Amazing place....

357793,14562435,2014-06-22,15319322,Gaia,The view from City Chic was even more perfectly beautiful than the pictures showed and that we could have imagined.  The accommodations were clean  stylish  and more than adequate  exactly as had been described.   I never did figure out how to dry my hair in the upstairs bedroom using a mirror but that was a minor inconvenience.  The people who attended the reception desk were thoroughly delightful and helpful and we always felt safe and secure.  Since we arrived later in the evening  a lovely addition would have been a few tea bags andor a small amount of ground coffee for the first morning.  We would not hesitate to stay at City Chic ifwhen we return to Cape Town.
357793,15481021,2014-07-10,10461255,Sandra,This was a wonderful apartment with great views of Table Mountain and a very convenient location.  We had some problems getting onto WiFi but Mike came by and spent a couple of hours with us setting us up and showing us around the neighbourhood.  He also recommend a great place for dinner.  Everything we needed for our 4 night stay was provided and we would highly recommend it as a great place to stay in Cape Town.
357793,15900238,2014-07-18,10681721,Joe,Liliane was an excellent host who provided us with detailed instructions and arranged a taxi for our arrival. The unit was spacious  clean  and had amazing views. The location is central and only a short and cheap cab ride to the VA waterfront. Overall  great value with an attentive host. Would recommend to friends.

The location close to the VA Waterfront is really great  thanks to the central location you can also get to other sights very quickly and easily. In addition  Chris is a really great host who has a lot of useful tips ready.
782208,608505765248144200,2022-04-19,112135280,James,Amazing place
357793,17447083,2014-08-12,14417413,Marco,We me  my wife and 2 kids spent 4 nights at City Chic. It was a great The apartment was as described  but the view is nicer. The instructions pack that Mike and Liliane sent to us were very precise  regarding the flat  parking and surroundings. We rented a car which was a plus  since the city is easy to drive  and very convenient to go to places like Cape Point and the wine country. Cape Town is a fantastic city and we left much to see. We will come back
357793,18934700,2014-09-03,11490150,Deborah,Loved the location and apartment.  Liliane provided detailed info and even arranged for a local to pick us up very late from the airport for a very reasonable price.  Gorgeous views from the apartment.  Great value.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
357793,21216402,2014-10-13,20682980,Kristi,The aparment is an amazing penthouse with stunning views of Table Mountain  Devils Peak and Lions Head. It has all you need self catering wise  and a nice balcony to soak up the view whilst drinking your morning coffee. We didn't really speak to Mike much  but Liliane was very helpful and also all you need of info is written up for you in the aparment. Recommended
357793,22822892,2014-11-16,11831753,Jennifer,Excellent city centre location with parking - so important in Cape Town. Spacious  well equipped apartment with a fantastic view of Table Mountain. We met Mike who was very helpful and he left his mobile number just in case - but not needed as the information provided before we arrived and that in the apartment was extensive and very helpful. We loved Cape Town and would recommend this apartment without hesitation.
357793,24044919,2014-12-18,10138480,Alison,The City Chic Apartment was everything we thought it would be and more The apartment was exactly as described  fit four people perfectly and the views were outstanding Liliane was timely with responses and they provided ample information about the neighborhood and general activities to do while in Cape Town.  Thank you Liliane and Mike
357793,25260452,2015-01-11,1263712,Amanda,Had a little problem with broken locks when I first arrived  but that eventually got resolved. The apartment is spacious and located well. The views are as described and worth the price.
357793,25491018,2015-01-18,4505565,Edna,Liliane kept in touch by email and phone.  very responsive.  Wonderful view  very clean and spacious  comfortable beds.
357793,25837099,2015-01-27,1389481,Julie,From the moment we booked this apartment we received good communication and information from Mike and Liliane. The apartment  was spotlessly clean when we arrived  in a safe and secure building and a great location within in the City. The apartment was well equipped  comfortable and a pleasure to stay in. The photographs do not do it justice. If we are lucky enough to return to Cape Town in the future I would without doubt stay here again. Thank you from Julie and Jonathan.
357793,28511062,2015-03-25,12163369,Kim,Mike and Liliane were fantastic hosts They answered all of our questions before our stay and promptly followed up on any questions while we were in Cape Town. City Chic was an amazing location  right in the middle of everything It was an easy walk to many sites  or a quick uber ride away. We loved the deck and enjoyed the views of table mountain. I highly recommend city chic
357793,28979290,2015-04-02,7471220,Paul,Gorgeous Penthouse  with spectacular views of Table Mountain. So centrally located we didn't need a hire car. Walking distance to restaurants and the Hop on hop off bus  takes you everywhere. The Penthouse had everything we could possibly need to compliment our wonderful stay in Cape Town. Liliane was extremely helpful and responded quickly and efficiently to all requests. We would definitely use Greg and Liliane's place again.
357793,34402169,2015-06-08,11994852,Vanessa,The host was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. The apartment was just as described  perfectly clean and well equipped. The location is in great walking distance to both Bree and long street.
357793,36008612,2015-06-24,30316284,Eli,Great location in the center of the city. Everything was in good order and we all wish we had more than three days in Cape Town.
357793,36849624,2015-07-02,13496022,Kathy,Our hosts made us feel extremely welcome by giving us early access to the apartment - we were waaaaaay early but since we are traveling in southern Africa for 3 months   we had a 4WD FULL of stuff.  They were very gracious and accommodating - we were most grateful.  The apartment's view is to-die-for and the apartment was cozy and warm - this being winter  was most welcome.  We had a lovely visit.
357793,37439067,2015-07-07,7790835,Raymond,The location of the apartment dictates that security awareness is high and depending on where you come from that can be confronting. Downtown during a weekend is very quiet and not much to offer in this locality. However  everybody we met was friendly and helpful.
357793,38372467,2015-07-15,29276075,Stephen,Lovely apartment with amazing views in central Cape Town. The owners were very communicative and helped arrange transport as well. We loved it
357793,39179001,2015-07-21,34821833,April,Awesome place to stay while in Cape Town. The location is great You can walk or take a R20 uber to most places. The view is amazing I loved watching the sunrise over the mountains every morning. Lots of space in the unit as well.
357793,41511558,2015-08-07,4928697,Lauri,This is a great apartment  very well situated with a gorgeous view of Table Mountain from the living room and balcony. It was perfect for us as a family of 4 adults with lots of places  like the waterfront  within walking distance. We booked this really last minute and everything was sorted very easily and efficiently over a few emails. Mike and Liliane provide a lot of information about the apartment and its access  as well as tourist info and things to do. We were really happy to find this place was available as the place we were staying in not airbnb wasn't great Note to self for next time  check airbnb first Thanks for making this lovely place available
357793,46463473,2015-09-11,13904893,Irene,The apartment views really are fabulous  This is right in the city center as advertised.  The area is great for exploring during the day  though you do need to be a bit cautious at night.  I would not recommending walking around by yourself in the evening in this area  just use common sense.  The hosts were informative  and the building has 24 hour lobby guard so that was helpful as well.  I would recommend staying here
357793,49971587,2015-10-08,7002689,Eeva-Liisa  Knut,This apartment in the heart of Cape Town can absolutely be recommended It is spacious  clean and well equipped. The beds are very comfortable and the view to Table mountain and Lions head is superb A few very minor details could be improved.
357793,50423389,2015-10-12,13155819,James,This penthouse apartment could not have been in a more ideal location.  The views are fantastic and within easy walking distance from some of the must see attractions of Cape Town.  It was clean and very modern with much space for four.  We joined another couple with separate floors for each couple.  Liliane was very accomodating in allowing us to store our luggage in the apartment for an extra two hours on our final day so we did not need to get to the airport for a long wait before our flight returned to the USA.
357793,56654584,2015-12-16,2217341,Dina,We had a wonderful birthday celebration in Cape Town. Liliane was very accommodating and the entire stay went without any snags
357793,59271474,2016-01-09,20121364,Rick,Lovely apartment  would stay there again if in Cape Town.  Airport pick was perfect standing there waiting for us. Couldn't have ask for anymore form the apartment. Host answer text very quick. Unfortunately pervious customers lost pool card and it took a few for the replacement  due to bank holidays.
357793,60880200,2016-01-29,44773980,Katja,Great place  awesome view  pleasant owners Everything was as in the discription. We had a brilliant time 
357793,62975489,2016-02-19,42091993,Nancy,Really lovely apartment with great views of table mountain. Fully equipped with everything you need for a couple of nights and check incheck out was very easy. Communication with the host was also very good. Location is really good and we found some nice cafes nearby and would also recommend Jazz at The Crypt to any future guests. Only thing we noticed was a night times there were some strange characters hanging around close by to the apartment block so would just say to future guests to be cautious if out late at night but we couldn't fault the apartment. Also used transportation provided by the hosts which was great and very reasonable  driver was extremely helpful on tips and advice on what to do
782208,625820524449310126,2022-05-13,14649388,Fiona,Lovely house and perfect host The house is perfect for a large family or for a group of friends travelling together. We stayed for work and it was perfect for us. Plenty of space and Chris was a great host. Situated close to everything that you needed in Cape Town.
357793,63447528,2016-02-23,26228574,Ken,Liliane always answered all of our questions promptly as we were planning for our trip to Cape Town.  She sent us extensive directions for the condo and area we would be living in.   The condo is amazing.  Right in the center of town.  Gorgeous view of table mountain.  Beds great and all needed supplies to make our stay perfect.  What more could you want.
357793,64357505,2016-03-03,49613190,Maike,We had an awesome stay and really enjoyed the time in the appartment We would love to come again any time again We can truly recommend the appartment- especially the view on table mountain is amazing Thanks so much
357793,64751051,2016-03-08,29906856,Eric,Mike and Liliane were great. Liliane kept us posted on access  parking etc. Very accommodating in arranging an early arrival time. The apartment was really great  very comfortable  great view of Table Mountain  and the pictures are an acccurate reflection of the place. Also very central for us needed quick access to down-town Cape Town for our cycle race. Also great location for anyone wanting to tour the city and the historical buildings  etc.
357793,67816453,2016-03-31,20161237,Antonieta,The apartment was very nice  well decorated  perfect details and with everything you need. The location of the apartment is excellent   because it is close to all  the tourist bus   markets  shops  museums  gardens  and all the tourist attractions. You wake up with a perfect view of Table Mountain. I will return to the apartment in my next visit. Thank you for everything Mike  Liliane
357793,69989425,2016-04-15,35402407,Godfried,Very nice clean apartment with fantastic views. The pictures don't do the view justice. Mike and Liliane were very helpful
357793,73241918,2016-05-07,24949983,Renske,A lovely view of Table Mountain. The appartment was as described. The location is very central and close to everything. Security is excellent inside the apartment block.
357793,78826206,2016-06-09,36292523,Patricia,This apartment was exactly as described and lovely in every way.  Our son was our local tour guide making the trip extra nice.  The desk staff was helpful and using Uber to go tofrom the location was super easy.   The view of Table Mountain  Lion's Head and Devil's Peak was a wonderful way to greet each day and close out every evening.  We miss Cape Town already
357793,80953475,2016-06-20,8757457,Anja,Fantastic apartment with unforgettable view
357793,81506006,2016-06-23,23873968,Olivia,The apartment was great and in a great location. Loved the views of Table Mountain and being close to everything Would definitely stay here again. 
357793,83602415,2016-07-03,10753649,Graham,Booking arrangements were all OK. Any problems such as lack of hot water and TV operations were promptly attended too. We thought that the promotion of the apartment is over hyped. It speaks of superb  chic' and comments include references to it being luxury We don't think that compared with accommodations we have experienced  in the UK  Western Europe  US  Canada  Australia and NZ that those terms are appropriate. The apartment is clean  modern and centrally located. It has  a very good Wi-Fi service. It is also security wise - quite secure. We were there in Winter and found it to be cold  even with the air conditioner on most of the heat goes up the stair well. The flimsy window curtains do not keep the heat in the room. Whilst watching TV at night we had to have a blanket on. We chose to stay in the compact downstairs bedroom. There are 4 single beds - 2 in the upstairs loft area and 2 downstairs. I slept in the bed near the window and found that there were nights when the air conditioning plant for the building which operates 247 did keep me awake. I then understood why an earlier review mentions that ear plugs could be handy - especially if you are a light sleeper. There is like many other apartments in Cape Town an excellent view of Table Mountain.
782208,646171708056743724,2022-06-10,229028763,Conor,Our stay at Wessels house was absolute perfection. The house is spacious  and well kitted. They've paid a lot of attention to detail  and Chris is very accommodating and lovely to deal with. Thanks for our awesome stay Chris
782208,654830495961905372,2022-06-22,6114115,Fahad,lovely and beautiful house with perfect location. it has every thing you need for comfortable stay at green point
782208,700562649665388701,2022-08-24,166881972,Michelle,This is a fantastic house in a super location. Chris was very communicative and helpful and answered all our questions promptly. He went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The house has ample room for large groups and beautiful outdoor space. Everything was provided including shower gel and shampoo and towels. We were able to walk to many of the activities we wanted to do in the city. Highly recommend Wessels House
782208,714255676217608244,2022-09-12,1799517,Richard,Great central property  ideal for barsrestaurants and green point stadium. Chris gave some great recommendations for eating  safety etc..
782208,717221951479270238,2022-09-16,151992945,Gordon,Thanks for warm welcome - great place and will be back
782208,732448952242634095,2022-10-07,26199874,Colyn,Very central for work in and around CBD but also to travel around Cape Town. Comfortable space outside and indoors especially the porch area
782208,750497134121963941,2022-11-01,189032203,Amy,Fantastic house in a great location. The house is beautifully designed and spacious the photos don't do it justice. Very convenientfor the VA waterfront and a very short walk from a great strip of shops and restaurants in Green Point. We felt safe due to good security. Chris checked us in in person and was very helpful showing us the house  its features and giving us recommendations. We wouldrecommend Chris' place.
357793,85086782,2016-07-10,18787963,Jensen,We had a lovely 3 nights at this great apartment. It was as advertised and the pictures are accurate. The place had good wifi. The beds were comfortable and warm but the apartment doesn't have any heating so it was a bit cold at night. The part of town is central but quite away from all the tourist restaurants etc. Excellent place though.
357793,91595394,2016-08-06,79040746,Yusuf,This place was amazing. The view was the first thing we noticed. It was great to just relax outside on the balcony and watch the stars. The TV didn't work  but we didn't bother to contact the hosts because we weren't interested in watching TV anyway we had too much to do in the city. The location is great  the markets were walkable  bokaap was walking distance  and long street is walkable. You should be mindful of the path you take  because there are beggars  but if you walk in a group you should be fine. The beds were comfortable  the lower level bedroom was a little bit noisy because some generator sound was constantly running  but I didn't mind it felt like a sound machine for me. Bathroom was clean and nice  though it is a little hard to get privacy because the door is a sliding screen that doesn't seal. However  the room has a door which you can shut completely. The lofted bedroom has great views and is very spacious. The laundry machine is not very efficient. It takes a while to wash and spin and dry your clothes and you cannot put too much clothes in. It's better than nothing though. Overall I loved this place. Nice views  good price  great location.
357793,95718483,2016-08-20,5659789,Amalia,Malheureusement nous n'avons rencontr personne lors de la rception du logement. C'est trs dommage et dommageable  car lorsque l'on constate des disfonctionnements alors tout devient compliqu.  Si la vue est extraordinaire  et le logement situ dans le coeur de la ville  le quartier n'est pas top le soir... il y a beaucoup de SDF et de drogus sur la place face  l'entre de l'immeuble. On ne peut sortir sans tre interpell.  L'appartement pourrait tre confortable  si les chambres ne donnaient pas sur les machineries de l'immeuble... Il y a constamment un bruit de fond  qui selon les personnes  peut prendre plus ou moins d'importance. Pour nous c'tait insupportable. Nous avons senti beaucoup de mauvaise foi  ce sujet de la part des htes. Nous avons fait part de ce problme  airbnb qui suite  une vido  a pu constater le problme  puis  a pris le problme en considration.
357793,97083988,2016-08-25,47644154,Agnes,We had travelled to SA for our nephews wedding and stayed at this beautiful apartment in the centre of the city of Cape Town with wonderful views over Table Mountain. It was around 20mins walk from the VA waterfront with wonderful shops  restaurants and bars. From the Adderly Street exit to the rear of the building there is excellent public transport and many taxis which makes it very easy to get around. Our host Mike visited us the day after we arrived to ensure that we had everything we needed. He even returned again later with some milk as it was Sunday and most of the shops were closed So thank you Mike. We had a fantastic time in Cape Town and will definitely return.
357793,98956208,2016-09-02,56002792,Robert,Quartier trs sympathique. Localisation idale pour visiter la ville avec une vue magnifique sur Table Mountain. Les htes sont trs sympathiques et ont arrang un accs ais  l'appartement. Je recommande cet appartement.
357793,101945253,2016-09-16,30704136,Katherine,Mike and Liliane were very responsive hosts with a very nice place to stay in Cape Town. The apartment looks exactly as it does in pictures  and the building is very secure with a doorman and a keypad lock on the door to the apartment. They also provide a safe for your belongings. We loved staying downtown due to the amazing restaurants nearby however  the fact that the apartment complex entrance was on a side street did not make us feel as safe as we would have liked. We took ubers at night and did not feel comfortable walking around the neighborhood on the smaller streets near the apartment.
357793,103082328,2016-09-20,22134589,Jorge,Great place right in the middle of Cape Town  close to everything. The view of Table Mountain is amazing Liliane made all the efforts to make it simple and clear how to get there and park. The staff in the building were very friendly and helpful. The WiFi connection was also very good and fast. Everything went smoothly in our trip Completely recommendable for a stay in Cape Town.
357793,106205443,2016-10-04,43117219,Andreas,Phantastischer Ausblick vom Balkon auf den Tafelberg  Company-Garden-Park und halb Kapstadt wirklich noch schner als auf dem Foto super-zentral sehr gepflegt da im unteren kleinen Schlafzimmer ziemlich krftige Lftergerusche den Schlaf doch stren knnen  wrde ich das Appartement nur fr 2 Gste empfehlen  die das ruhige groe Hauptschlafzimmer mit groem Doppelbett nutzen sehr gute Beschreibung der Lage sehr bequem erreichbarer bewachter Parkplatz im Nebenhaus ist inklusive - sehr wichtig  wenn man mit Auto anreist vom Parkplatz direkter Zugang zum Fahrstuhl Fahrstuhl geht nicht ganz bis auf Etage der Eingangstr sondern kleine schmale Treppe ist noch zu nehmen ggf. vielleicht problematisch fr ltere mit schwerem Gepck nicht versumen Alte Kirche direkt im Nebenhaus offen von 10 bis 14 h  District 6 Museum um die Ecke
357793,112837184,2016-11-07,60887201,Shirley,Mike and Liliane kept in touch by text and email and made sure we had all the information we needed to access the apartment.  Everything was as described and we had a great time.  Ideally located with fantastic views of Table Mountain  Lion's Head and Signal Hill.  Easy walk to Long Street and the city tour buses plus various restaurants around too.  The concierge team for the building were very helpful
357793,113818184,2016-11-13,50376460,Amanda,what a great place. the value was amazing and the beautiful apartment was EXACTLY like the photos. location is great  the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. loved it. and cape town is amazing.
357793,115447846,2016-11-24,41552099,Deirdre,The apartment was fantastic. Perfect location. We had a great experience and loved Cape Town Thank you Mike  Liliane
357793,116097808,2016-11-27,64718720,Uwe,Beautiful view from the balcony  perfect located close to many restaurants and bars.
357793,116831762,2016-12-03,61818818,Ann,We found the apartment all as described  clean and comfortable and appreciated arrangements for early check in. Great view and we liked the location  finding it a good location for access to the major sites within the city and good links to airport and cape point. Nearby taxi rank useful. Very good package of information provided by Mike and Liliane prior to arrival. We felt safe in this neighbourhood and the apartment has good security.
782208,793262091350391949,2022-12-30,30305531,Eakta,This is an amazing place really close to everywhere you want to visit in Cape Town. The house is much more beautiful than the photographs and everything was very comfortable and easy to figure out.  The pool was lovely and we enjoyed eating breakfast outside.  The host is very nice and helpful with things to do and see as well as answering questions that we had.
357793,121938419,2016-12-19,8599323,Bruno,Magnificent appartement Mike and Liliane did their best to answer our questions and doubts we had regarding the arrival and the parking place. Appartement was very clean and has basically everything you need for self catering. View is splendid and the neighborhood is very pleasant and central. The room from downstairs can be a bit noisy for those who doesn't have a deep sleep because of the building air conditioning or other machinery  but nothing that some ear plugs couldn't solve.
782208,830948859629079594,2023-02-20,27114092,Emma,I stayed at Chriss place with a group of friends for a week and it was perfect The location is excellent and the space is wonderful. Chris was such a great host  very helpful and responsive before and during our trip  and welcomed us to the house and gave us some really great tips for the area. Would definitely recommend Wessels house and would very happily come back. Thanks Chris
357793,140318891,2017-03-29,79526398,Katie,Mike  Liliane's place is the PERFECT location for a city-based stay You can't beat the views of Table Mountain and Lion's Head. The balcony is incredible. The location is perfect to explore the city and surrounding areas. Great walkability to a lot of attractions and also easy to get an uber. Wonderful amenities  close to shops and restaurants  and great value. Look no further
357793,141998878,2017-04-06,112896540,Jack,Had an amazing time here with my 2 friends for a few days. It is bang in the middle of town so lots of things close by  but would recommend cabs for any real journey as in the whole of central Cape Town you have to be wary of your surroundings. The view is unreal in this apartment  we spent our first evening in Cape Town sitting on the balcony having a beer watching the sun go down with table mountain right in front of you  it was amazing. All in all great clean apartment  would definitely recommend
357793,147474778,2017-04-27,59526251,Thomas,Great apartment in the city center of Cape Town. The view is amazing.
357793,148606727,2017-05-01,32237583,Terry,Overall a wonderful experience and Liliane followed up to see if we had arrived safely  which is a nice touch. The apartment is well appointed and perfectly positioned in Cape Town to everything.
357793,150930167,2017-05-10,17554578,Jessica,We had a great time staying at Mike  Liliane's place. Everything was as expected and they were great about keeping in contact with us  and even helped us schedule airport transfers. The view is absolutely amazing although I am a little scared of heights and the apartment is on the top floor.  I enjoyed hiking and soaking my sore legs in the beautiful bathtub. Also  we really enjoyed eating at Bukhara a Indian restaurant of few blocks away that I would highly recommend.  Overall  everything was fantastic
357793,152942117,2017-05-19,118804569,Ann,The view out of the appartement  was  impressie  The appartement  is beautyful and clean.
357793,154155320,2017-05-23,41111335,Brian,Stunning views. Very clean. Wonderful to have an easily accessible garage parking space. High value for price.
357793,156302276,2017-05-30,17565452,Felipe,This is an amazing apartment. The location is perfect  Mike and Liliane is very nice people  easy to comunicate with them and the view of table mountain is awesome.
357793,159016982,2017-06-09,80597959,Stacey,We three of us had an excellent three night stay at City Chic - the apartment is beautiful  very clean and has an amazing view. Location is central  we were there as tourists and had an easy time getting in and out of the City Bowl area with our car to go adventure around. Instructions left by Mike  Liliane were spot on and easy to follow - they were responsive to our requests and questions. We definitely recommend and hope to be back for another stay
357793,160415081,2017-06-14,9784501,Donald,You simply can not go wrong. Liliane and mikes home is as it appears and more. Location is great The information packet upon arrival is so detailed as to places to eat  directions  times that stores open and close days vs weekends  where to shop.......felt very welcomed. NO SURPRISES
357793,164381883,2017-06-27,11790335,Sheila,Great apartment in central location in Cape Town  easy access to waterfront  table mountain etc. Hosts really helpful in arranging airport collection. Access straight forward and all worked out well.
357793,169276212,2017-07-12,36444521,Richard,Nicely located  great views  comfortable beds and furniture  and close to tourist attractions.  Make sure lights are plugged in.  We had no light for the sink vanity area for a couple of days only to find out it was unplugged.  Mike was very responsive when the problem was brought to his attention and the bulbs were changed and then electrician arrived and found the problem.
357793,170662842,2017-07-16,136224025,Lynette,The view from the balcony was stunning. The area very central we walked the city flat  enjoyed the food at the various restaurants. Amazing accommodation overall will definitely recommend friends and family.
357793,172457727,2017-07-21,12380866,Paul,The location is sensational and the view of the city and Table Mountain is unsurpassed. We would definitely stay there again.

357793,178231732,2017-08-05,8907085,Nicole,Een mooi appartement met een geweldig uitzicht. Midden in de city en overal dichtbij. Een echte aanrader
357793,179769161,2017-08-08,16546233,Ilana,The pictures of the view on table mountain from the terrace don't do the view justice The apartment was spotless and had everything you could possibly need. The location is excellent and the beds are divine. We should have booked another day just to stay in and relax
357793,186580614,2017-08-25,114179645,Cornelie,A beautiful appartement in the center of Cape Town   with a great view on the table mountain.  Nearby al the places you want to visit  like Bo kaap  Waterfront  Cape the good hope  table mountain etc etc...
357793,188597069,2017-08-30,10999063,Tanya,Very central location  super helpful doormen  amazing view
357793,203073621,2017-10-14,32214537,Heather,Had a wonderful 5-star stay at Mike  Liliane's They are very quick to respond to messages which is much appreciated. The apartment is great. BEAUTIFUL VIEWS The main bedroom is in the upper loft section with beautiful skylights looking out at Table Mountain and Lion's Head. Main room in the apartment also looks out to a beautiful view. Apartment has all the amenities you may need for cooking fridge  freezer  microwave  oven and bowlspots and pans and utensils for cooking. WiFi worked fine. We never were able to figure out the TV but we weren't visiting Cape Town to watch TV anyway so it wasn't a bother.  The location is perfect for walking to many of the tourist sites in the city Bo Kaap  Company Gardens  Greenmarket Square  restaurants...and walkable to the tourist offices as well if you choose to sign up for a tour group. Uber and Tour pickups were easy as the address is simple to find. I definitely hope to stay here again next time I visit Cape Town. Thank you ML
357793,209744866,2017-11-05,41210756,Nancy,Fabulous flat in a great location and great value  It was so convenient to have a parking space too.  The staff at the condo front desk were also an added bonus  as they were friendly and helpful.  Overall  I can't wait to come to Cape Town again and I would definitely try and snag this flat again  Thanks so Mike and Liliane
782208,865826018175029364,2023-04-09,14080279,Julia,Fantastic stopover in Cape Town We needed flexible space for our multi-gen family and Chris graciously fenced off the pool and added on the studio to our reservation after the initial booking. Pam met us and was a delight
782208,869354293280454297,2023-04-14,441486243,Lemmy,Chris went out of his way to welcome us  we just got married and were spending the weekend with family and friends in Cape Town. We requested for an additional day and he was willing to make it work for us so we didnt end up moving to a hotel for one day. The area is so beautiful and it was a pleasure to have such a beautiful space to relax after the tours we did.
782208,876696967281056148,2023-04-24,166160290,Laurie,We had a great stay  the place and location is fantastic and Chris was extremely helpful with recommendations.
782208,881703602479896653,2023-05-01,8754067,Lucie,Chris a t un super hte Trs belle maison  trs bien place  je recommande  Nous avons pass un super sjour.
782208,954886027567679560,2023-08-10,53732140,Yasser,Chris was an excellent host. Very responsive and easy to communicate with. He made us feel home from the moment we checked-in. He shared info and recommendations relating to Cape Town and its surroundings. The location is near many coffee shops and restaurant. It takes 10-15 min walk to the waterfront. The house is a bit old so dont expect a new or a modern place.
782208,974507002611501718,2023-09-06,298995049,Shauna,Chris was very helpful and it was easy to communicate with him. Check in and out was easy. The house is in an ideal location close to shops and restaurants. There is security on the street which gives a sense of safety. The house is very spacious and the outside area is a lovely area to chill. The area was quiet and easy to sleep in. Although it cannot be helped  the load shedding is very inconvenient as it happens at peak times. The house was quite cold because of this and also because of the time of year. There was some mould in the twin room upstairs and also there is no Wi-Fi in the room downstairs. Overall this is an ideal place to stay if youre looking for a safe area close to amenities.
782208,1007882952208082371,2023-10-22,124383837,Robert,Beautiful home in a central location in Cape Town. Chris was an amazing host who made us feel welcome and gave several great local recommendations.
782208,1083192927948427972,2024-02-03,65509493,Caroline,Chris greeted us at check-in. He also put groceries in the refrigerator for our arrival. Really kind host.
782208,1085423016211796419,2024-02-06,4108902,Natale,Chris was very helpful and informative. The house was clean but there were we few things that need attention  we couldnt open a window and really craved fresh air in the basement  the room also had a leak from the ceiling. We thought we had secure parking but ended up parking in the street. Location is good and the outside area is lovely but can only be enjoyed until 10pm. Having lights and internet during load shedding is a great bonus.
782208,1091898785420842934,2024-02-15,14216149,Amelia,Chris's apartment was stunning Excellent location  very peaceful and felt very homely. The pool  garden were a highlight  whilst all the bedrooms were incredibly comfortable. Chris gave us really useful advice for where to visit 1010
790177,223447257,2018-01-01,147403279,Johann,We had a very welcoming stay at Diana and Rob. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe and the flatlet is spacious.

357793,224475801,2018-01-03,90964173,Sam,The apartment was really well equipped  clean  and well located - everything is within walking distance or alternatively a very cheapshort uber journey away.
357793,228297541,2018-01-19,52911876,Ingrid,Excellent location  stylish  clean  safe  good communication with owner
357793,229174407,2018-01-22,132168647,Laura,The Penthouse Appartement had a fantastic view We felt very safe and comfortable.
357793,247334079,2018-03-28,57280735,Rob,Absolutely wonderful apartment and stunning views Parking is very convenient if a few floors up in the multi storey. Area is vibrant and exciting  but for travellers new to Cape Town is quite edgy in the evenings. Liliane was incredibly helpful and always available to help.

357793,256677111,2018-04-23,179228892,Zoe,Stayed here for one of the best vacations Ive ever had. The location was perfect and the space very clean and comfortable. Just FYI for any early risers cafes in Cape Town dont open till after 9 am on Sundays  so its a good idea to keep something to eat in the kitchen.

Everything was seamless and comprehensive list ranging from how to operate the TV to the places to go for dinner  Internet etc the list was helpful. Rob was constantly checking on us if everything was in order which demonstrated the quality of a good host. I have enjoyed my stay and managed to finish the 2 books that I started 11 months ago also managed to go for a run every morning. Great stay I will definitely stay there when I visit Cape Town again.
795400,58870270,2016-01-05,2561806,Nina,My friend and I enjoyed staying at Rob's a lot. His clean and cozy apartment was perfectly located for our stay in Cape Town. Less than a ten-minutes drive to the city centre it offers a laid-back vibe and cool neighbourhood cafs and restaurants. Communication with Rob was also very easy  he responded to all messages quickly and was always very friendly and helpful.
795400,221608077,2017-12-27,4948385,Christoph,Robs place was the perfect location  very stylish and perfectly located in Woodstock  a lively and nice neighborhood. For us as a small family it was perfect to stay in a real neighborhood an being only 5 minutes from down town Cape Town.

357793,315663146,2018-08-29,28680648,Danielle,Liliane was a wonderful host . We were 4 girls travelling from the US and we were somewhat nervous as we had a very late arrival in to Cape Town . Liliane provided us with the most thorough of directions from the airport as well as instructions for entering the condo . There was zero room for error and the safety and security of the parking garage and condo building put any worries we had to ease . We woke up to the most spectacular of views of table mountain in the morning as well as lovely snacks left by Liliane . The condo was clean  spacious   and in an amazing location . The only negative I have to share is that I wish we had more nights to spend here . 
357793,319723392,2018-09-07,45715974,Sarah,This apartment is in a great central location overlooking Table Mountain. The view is breathtaking and having a terrace is a real bonus. The flat is well equipped  spacious  clean. Ideal for 4 adults. We also rented a car for some days so the secure in town parking was fabulous. Liliane was very helpful with check in and arranged airport transfers for us. Great value  we recommend it as a good base for exploring the city  the Cape. Good places to eat  drink nearby too.
357793,327609929,2018-09-24,172846011,Sophie,Great location and great apartment  very easy directions on how to get there  the parking is easy and secure too. We had no hassle checking in either which was just perfect after our long flight to Cape Town. Also it wasn't too far to walk to the VA waterfront which was good too. Overall we had a lovely week at this apartment we were sad to leave it.

It was vibrant  filled with lots of locals going about their daily lives and i felt we got to see the real Cape Town. The apartment is located near some of the nicest bars and restaurants on BreeShortmarket. Its a 30 minute walk to the Waterfront. Liliane had very kindly left a freshly made delicious focaccia  biscotti  milk  coffee and tea. These were much appreciated. Liliane also arranged transfers to the airport  which was great.

Great view and location with easy access to everything. All amenities in the property were exactly as described in the listing. Excellent communications with the host  she came in person to insure that our Uber could get to the front of the building  since there were road closures due to public events on the date of our check-in and the Police was refusing us access. Great value for the money.  If I'm in Cape Town again   will definitely stay there.

795614,12177362,2014-04-25,3466241,Alex,Wir waren mit unseren 4 Kids ber Ostern fr 8 Tage bei Lisa und Familie zu Gast. Alles hat reibungslos funktioniert. Das Haus ist gross  alles war sauber und vom Masterbedroom und dem Esszimmer hat man einen tollen Blick auf Lions Head  Table Mt. bis zum Devils Peak - die Stadt sieht man natrlich auch. Schon cool morgens beim ersten Licht sogar die Cedar Monatains aus dem Bett am Horizont sehen zu knnen. Bder sind sehr stylish und die Kche gut ausgestattet. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefhlt und hatten einen coolen Urlaub. Das Haus hat auch ein moderne Alarmanlage mit in house Mode - wenn man ganz sicher schlafen will. Hatten wir mal an  mal nicht. In der Gegend auch Kraut hill genannt  aber eigentlich nicht ntig. Viele Restaurants zu Fuss in 10 min zu erreichen.
795614,24802052,2015-01-03,4281064,Thorsten,Lisa's House is amazing. We stayed with out whole family and had a wonderful time. From the beginning during our first AirBNB  contact  followed by a warm welcome by Lisa's Family and Housekeeper and during our stay. The house is even more beautiful in reality and the view to the table mountain and over the city is spectacular by day and night. We'd love to come back.
795614,27194587,2015-02-28,17195499,Sheila,Two of our party of six arrived one night earlier than expected and Lisa kindly let them stay which was much appreciated. The house is in a lovely part of Cape Town and views are as spectacular as billed. We were very comfortable here during our week in Cape Town. A word of warning for those past the first flush of youth and fitness  there are quite a few stairs both outside and within the house. Outside has no handrail and inside you could walk off the edge of steps and stairs so the very youngoldinebriated need to be careful. We would also have welcomed some cupboard and hanging space ground floor bedroom has none. The bathrooms were excellent and the mid floor bedroom and top floor living room have amazing views of Table Mountain and the surrounding area. We only used the garden once as the wind was pretty bad but it was nice to sit outside. A bit of a tutorial on the light switches might be helpful as they were tricky to work out. All in all a comfortable house in a suburb location with great access into Cape Town. We had a wonderful week here.
795614,37740677,2015-07-10,12674935,Janetta,My colleagues and I were in Cape Town for a conference and decided to stay at this beautiful house. Lisa was a responsive host swift communication. Arrival and departure details and processes were smooth and they left us lots of instructions and advice in the house manual. We found the location to be peaceful  yet convenient  and the views of Table Mountain can't be beat. Thank you to Lisa and her family for contributing to a lovely visit to South Africa for all of us
795614,58485159,2016-01-03,4922750,Keith,Beautiful home in very attractive neighborhood. Another plus is that the owners recommended Natasha Carter as a tour guide and driver  and she was fantastic Guests should be aware  however  that the house does not have air conditioning and can get very warm during hot weather. Also  the wireless internet was very slow  which is surprising for this type of rental.
795614,122829412,2016-12-26,82258053,Mark,We thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous location and home of Lisa and Leigh - great communication  generously non-intrusive though we knew they were available if we needed any assistance which we didn't. Loved the home which was as we expected - but even better. Stunning views which we will always remember - beautiful open plan living on the loungekitchen  woke up to Table Mtn every morning in the main bedroom. Thank you for sharing your home with us - it was a holiday we will never forget. Mark  Averil and family
795614,125854886,2017-01-08,15683987,Hilary,Beautiful home with wonderful views of Table Mountain. Close driving distance to restaurants  shopping  beaches and easy access to airport and vineyards.
795614,144510993,2017-04-16,13732282,Melissa,My family and I have recently returned from an 11 night stay at Lisa's beautiful home  and we just cannot fault it. The photos represent the property well but in person the views are just breath taking. Communication with Lisa was fantastic throughout our duration and she kindly greeted us and left some supplies to keep us going such as tea and coffee etc. Not only is the property itself absolutely stunning  the location is ideal. Walking distance to some local restaurants and shops and kloof street. We were able to get Uber's to and from the property as well with no problems. We had a wonderful stay at Lisa's and would absolutely recommend it
795614,147864307,2017-04-29,107844885,Martin,We stayed in April 2017 11 night in Lisa's house and had such a wonderful time there. The house is located in one of the oldest and most beautiful districts in town with small restaurants  bistros and shops within walking distance. The pictures are accurate and the view from the kitchen  living room  from two bedrooms as well as from the garden towards Table Mountain is just breathtaking. The communication worked out very well with Lisa and we all enjoyed our stay.
795614,223932200,2018-01-02,114490757,Sonja,Wir ber Weihnachten und Sylvester 201718 in Lisas und Leighs Haus. Es war einfach super. Ein schnes Haus  sehr modern und grozgig eingerichtet. Es war alles vorhanden  so dass es uns an nichts gefehlt hat. Der Blick auf den Tafelberg ist atemberaubend. Den Pool konnten wir aufgrund der Wasserrestriktion nicht verwenden. Ansonsten ein toller Urlaub in Kapstadt. Das Haus ist in jedem Fall zu empfehlen. Liebe Gre nach Kapstadt.
795614,366033666,2019-01-02,7716006,Jonathan,We had a great stay. The house has fabulous views over Cape Town and Table Mountain and is very well located for all that the local area and central Cape Town have to offer. It was clean and well-prepared and we would happily stay there again

Dennoch knnen wir die Unterkunft empfehlen  nicht zuletzt wegen der traumhaften Aussicht auf den Tafelberg und den Lions Head. Der Poolbereich ist ebenfalls sehr schn.

The home was sparkling clean  had a user-friendly guest bookcheck-in instructions  and came with all the amenities you could need including a safe and a thoughtful gift basket. It should be noted that the villa is one of several vacation rentals located on one subdivided property  so you will likely have neighbors unless you rent out the whole house. The property is located within walking distance of Clifton's main street and its beaches  and Mary-Louise is a friendly  professional  and extremely attentive host  Could not have imagined a better way to end our trip in South Africa. Thank you

We wish we had stayed there for our entire week in Cape Town.  Shannon had nice extras like beach towels and a beach bag which came in handy when we went down to Camps Bay beach.  Her husband was incredibly helpful when we arrived and helped us arrange a taxi for dinner that night.  I have nothing but great things to say about the studio and would absolutely stay again

357993,28859750,2015-03-31,2730499,Namrata,Perfect  modern studio apartment for exploring Cape Town  with an absolutely amazing view of the beach. So spoilt to wake up to that each morning Camps Bay is an idyllic spot within an easy distance to drive to central Cape Town having a car makes things much easier. The apartment is a great size for a couple  well thought out for all your needs and good layout with plenty of space. We only spent a few minutes with Shannon on our first day  but she was very friendly with lots of advice and we certainly felt happy to know we could call on her anytime  as she was on-site. However we definitely appreciated feeling comfortable enough to come and go as we pleased as the studio is very private. A great option for Cape Town - very highly recommended
357993,32539653,2015-05-19,30612546,Kim,Shannon was there to meet us and show us around and was kind enough to take our laundry too The studio is exactly as it is described with a stunning view of the ocean and Lion's Head.

357993,60844793,2016-01-28,3179389,Jennifer,Shannon made us feel very welcome. She was there to greet us and give us some great advice on where to go. The open lofty feel was great. Our favorite part was the gorgeous view out the whole wall of windows or from the balcony. The location was also great. We adventured out each day but we were always happy to come back to camps bay.  The bathroom door is glass and doesn't quite close all the way and right next to the bed  so being close with your travel partner is ideal. Otherwise everything was fantastic and we loved our stay
357993,61224070,2016-02-01,2010538,Gavin,Had a fantastic time at Shannon's apartment and perfect for 12 people. It is as described on the listing and would definitely stay here again. Thanks

357993,63894644,2016-02-28,24438882,Evan,Shannon welcomed us warmly but with little fuss  filling us in on some local tourist tips. The apartment is beautiful  bright  airy  modern and well-equipped  perfect for our needs and so well located in Camps Bay  just a 15 minute walk from the beachfront. The sunsets were gorgeous too  the view marred only by the unsightly top of the garage in front of the property - great if they could plant some foliage on it to cover the eyesore Some construction work was going on at ground level which jarred the ears but thankfully finished before sundown each day...
357993,72578169,2016-05-03,10064524,Lynton,Excellent place and excellent host. Will def stay here again

357993,137539767,2017-03-16,49184879,Mark,I'm a bachelor boy ageing  and this was the perfect spot for me. A quiet one room apartment lovely decor and high up above Camps Bay with great views of the beach front and Lions Head mountain. There is a good small super market just down the road and it's a pleasant 15 minute walk to the main beach strip. Few hills to go up and down but that's Camps Bay for me the walking was part of the enjoyment. The host Shannon was lovely and helpful being very flexible when I asked for anything like an early check in and late check out. For a single traveller or a couple with no kids who want peace and great views in a classy flat this is for you. A bit of fitness is important though. Climbing to be done up and down steps to the apartment and in and out of the main village. But an A from me.
357993,141446652,2017-04-03,50735593,Jonti,Great little studio apartment for 1 or 2 people. 15 min walk from the beach and shops with a small supermarket and restaurant 5 min away. Great view. Clean. Bright. Helpful host.

357993,410360363,2019-02-10,76750221,Julia,Shannon and her husband Gordon were absolutely wonderful hosts with excellent tips and the utmost hospitality. Their flat has a truly stunning view of Camps Bay and we enjoyed being in this part of town so much. Being able to sit out on the balcony with a bottle of wine and watch the sunset over the ocean is incredible. The space is ideal for a couple  is very clean and has everything you need we didn't do any cooking but kitchen appeared to be fully stocked with supplies and utensils. The water pressure in the shower is excellent. Wish we could have stayed longer  and would definitely come back

357993,534748044,2019-09-23,73206276,Polinah,Shannon and Gordon were exceptional. I was there for my sister's birthday and this place was made the birthday extra special. Very clean. Walking distance to Camps Bay beach. Loved it

357993,569946239,2019-11-28,73229670,Chris,Absolutely loved this studio and the views of Camps Bay are hard to beat. Just up the hill is the pipe track and some of the best walkinghiking Ive ever done. You can even take the trail all the way to the top of Table Mountain. Shannon was easy to communicate with and ensured I had all the information I needed.
357993,575024138,2019-12-09,33380702,Alastair,Superbly located and the perfect apartment to explore camps bay with your own private balcony. Very easy check in process and everything was ideal. Highly recommend and great value for money. Thank you
357993,727880111,2021-01-31,97593378,Rod,I stayed at Shannon and Gordons apartment for 4 weeks during lockdown and worked remotely for the most part. They were really great hosts and went out of their way to make my stay as comfortable as possible At the time alcohol was not sold in SA and Shannon shared some of their personal stock with me  which was very generous and a welcome touch  Also  at the start of my stay the internet was slightly slow to conduct video calls and Gordon went through all the trouble to upgrade the broadband so I could work more efficiently. No stone was left unturned If there was one minor thing to point out is that the road in front of the apartment can get busy at times but any noise can easily be blocked out by the stunning wall to ceiling double glazed glass doors if you need more privacy and quiet. The evenings and early mornings though are quiet and serene and the balcony is the perfect place to enjoy the sunset or sunrise with glass of wine or cup of coffee. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay Shannon and Gordon
357993,737493721,2021-03-08,276219177,Humphery,I enjoyed my stay  will definitely recommend.

357993,530147586882058176,2022-01-01,131464320,David,We had the perfect stay at Shannons studio. The place is beautiful  perfectly located and has stunning views from a sunny balcony We had a car so it was handy to have parking on site as we didnt use the car during our stay mainly due to the studio is being well located and a short walk to the beach or short Uber into Cape Town We loved how the studio was decorated with some of Shannons own art which made the studio so fresh  quirky and comfortable We want to thank Shannon and her husband for making us feel so welcome  helping us with our bags and being available for any recommendations during our stay and organising check in and out The perfect hosts Thank you
357993,767240796149056001,2022-11-24,10581208,Ryan,It was a great place. Lovely view. Clean.
357993,1026616153592699515,2023-11-17,50429159,Alexander,Loved the stay with Shannon from the first minute. The apartment has a lovely interior  nice view and all the furnishing you would need. There is a gas stationmini market right across the road and also good restaurants and breakfast spots in walking distance. If you're good on foot the camps bay city center is also only 20 minutes away for an even bigger variety of restaurants. Shannon and her husband are very kind and provided me with plenty of recommendations for my stay. The apartment is cleaned daily and is in pristine condition  they even provide a little power supply so you still have some light and wifi during load shedding. Would return here anytime when I visit Cape Town again Thanks for the amazing time Shannon.
357993,1083217924112228014,2024-02-03,375614900,Frank,Das Apartment entsprach dem Inserat. Leider war das Badezimmer sehr klein. Einige Gegenstnde waren renovierungsbedrftig. Das Internet hatte leider immer wieder Strungen. Woran das lag  weich nicht. Gordon hat sich aber immer wieder schnell bemht  es zum laufen zu bringen. Die Kommunikation mit Shannon und Gordon war immer sehr gut. Beide waren sehr hilfsbereit
357993,1086852913687270490,2024-02-08,20347436,Jeannine,View is very nice. We even saw humpback Wales from up there. mattress of bed is a pain. You cant really sleep there. You feel every spiral. We turnt it upside down. Was much better. GasStation in Front of the Apartment and street is really loud. Big Kitchen but no washing machine. Tiny Bathroom. Interior of Apartment seems new and modern but we felt it was more somehow put together randomly. For us it was more a Money printing Apartment with no Heart really. Sorry
800546,554874619,2019-10-27,46036140,Alexander,Great place  great view Check in was simple  cleaners come everyday and there is even an option to leave laundry with them.

800546,606305338275382031,2022-04-16,5539392,Jirapon,An excellent apartment to stay as a group of friends or family. The view from the balcony is spectacular especially from late afternoon until sundown. The host was very accommodating and communicative. We requested 3 sets of keys usually 2 are provided and the host provided them without a fuss. The only con is the road noise from the main road which can be disturbing at times. Apart from that  it was a great stay.
800546,619365387664814126,2022-05-04,39055842,Christian,Beautiful house  great location in camps bay and directly at the beach. Sunset is directly in front of the beautiful living area  balcony

800546,723668196252173436,2022-09-25,106683539,Jessica,I can only recommend staying at this spot. Glen beach villas has everything youre looking for  plus one of the most incredible sunsets youll ever see We stayed for 3 nights and Ive not slept so well in a long time. The beds were so comfortable  the house was very consciously designed. You can see a lot of thought went into the style and ergonomics of the place. What I loved most was how spacious and open plan the layout was. Its just a dream to stay with friends or family. Its a great space for hosting a big dinner with friends or a braai  and although we were 4 couples staying together  we still managed to have privacy. Its also just a quick 8min walk to the camps bay main road where youll find cafes  restaurants and bars. Wed love to come back again
800546,735316047025850156,2022-10-11,130209057,Thabo,This villa is absolutely stunning. Beautiful design and furniture and the ocean views are amazing. Our host was very friendly and response. I would 100 recommend staying here.
370531,2037531,2012-08-20,2352420,Elina,Claudia was great with communication before  and during the trip. The house was spotless when I moved in and both Richard and Claudia showed me how everything worked before they left.  They also left a very good guide for the house and the local area.  I highly recommend staying there
800546,751957754605510315,2022-11-03,421229135,Alan,An amazing family home with the sound of the surf from Glen Beach permeating the rooms.  The house was super comfortable for our extended family group. Well equipped and in an amazing location only metres from the beach and a very short walk to all the restaurants and cafes in Camps Bay.  Be aware that the entrance to the underground car parking is very tight if you are hiring a large 4x4.
800546,759286432900617075,2022-11-13,6235562,Nielen,Had a great stay beautiful place and great location.

The host Mary Louise is very responsive to any issues noted. I found the place dated in terms of furnishing and maintenance for the price point.
800546,815057919436341664,2023-01-29,32461686,Pedro,Great in every aspect. Thank you

800546,859192917725918660,2023-03-31,10259396,Bec,Fabulous property for in a lovely location   great views   nice pool . Very easy to get all to the beach and local restaurants . Having a manager to meet us and who was flexible with times as a bonus for us also
800546,863597571784961409,2023-04-06,102698479,Natasha,We would absolutely look to stay at Glen Beach Villas anytime we are in Cape Town. It is an amazing apartment and worked so well for us as two families travelling together - we were able to have a separate floor for sleeping for each family and then a shared livinglounge floor for day-time. It is so convenient for exploring the western cape during the day and walking to bars and restaurants in Camps Bay for brunch or at night. The servicing of the apartment during the stay was also fabulous. Lastly  the balcony has spectacular views from which to enjoy the beautiful sunsets.
370531,11973785,2014-04-20,4858724,Frederikke,We stayed in the house for 1 week  1 couple and 2 dogs. The space and the garden was great and the location was convenient - there is a dog park just down the street Restaurants and shopping nearby  easy to park on the quiet road  yet still close to the main road. Claudia's parents checked us in and out and all went well incl. communication with Claudia. We were happy that they were able to accommodate the four of us on such short notice.
370531,29380874,2015-04-07,9747436,Tammy,From the moment of my first contact with Claudia via email right up until checking out on my last day  this little gem on Trill Road in Observatory was an absolute dream. The house speaks for itself in the attention to design and everything is curated with integrity. The garden is an oasis  the home warm and comfortable and the community of observatory is a true reflection of South Africa's rainbow nation. You have everything you need from city life to nature  restaurants to fabric shops and museums and not to mention all the characters you come across that make up the beautiful city of Cape Town. This is a home away from home and there is a lot of love to be felt inside.
370531,123217432,2016-12-28,11703607,Maria,We have had a splendid stay in the large comfortable house. We didn't met Claudia personally  because she was not in town   but the communication was very smooth and she was very flexible to meet our wishes relating to arrival and departure  for which we are grateful. We knew already the neighborhood  the splendid supermarket and the laundry at walking distance. This time we discovered  pizzeria Narona  they make the best pizza's outside of Italy. It was our first visit of Cape Town in summer  and we were absolutely enchanted by the very large  beautiful garden. It was so nice staying there  that we had to think of good reasons to go out
370531,473735981,2019-06-22,6817896,Michael,claudia and richard are super friendly and easy-going their place is a real oasis in the heart of observatory  i can highly recommend it to anyone -

370531,609260279611581806,2022-04-20,12271810,Marissa,This is a gem of a house in Observatory. Lovingly decorated. Peaceful garden. Well equipped kitchen. A perfect respite from the bustle of Cape Town while being a stones throw from the dynamic and funky delights of Lower Main road. Also super convenient to groceries  the City Bowl  and UCT. I loved my stay here and felt welcomed  secure  and very much at a home away from home. Claudia is a gracious and kind host. I hope to be back
800546,946917720348261857,2023-07-30,371599766,Niresha,Perfectly situated. Neat. Perfectly curated interior designs and a great view The host was very helpful.

800546,1084603407809952139,2024-02-05,94765736,Simon,Perfect spot for a few days in Camps Bay. Accomodation was gorgeous
800546,1100570238558198872,2024-02-27,6992096,Zaac,Amazing stay are Glen Beach Villa. The sunsets are incredible  and location an easy walk to Camps Bay cafes and restaurants. The apartment has a Tesla battery so manages well with load shedding. All in all the villa was very well appointed  with everything you need. We had a great BBQ dinner our last night and it was just perfect.
800546,1131077542146779840,2024-04-09,17668868,Roz,Beautiful home  excellent location and magnificent views. Set up worked well for 2 families with 2  bedrooms on lower level and 2 on the upper level with the living area on the middle level
390198,1048976,2012-03-27,1942026,Margaret,Rita was an outstanding host and  her apartment exceeded our expectations. The views were as she said and her hospitality was second to none. Nothing was too much trouble for her and we were provided with private bathroom and towels. Her home is spotless. We had breakfast which gave a wide choice. Both myself and my friend Maggie felt as though we were staying with a friend rather than a host. We would without a doubt recommend her to anyone who wishes to experience Cape Town.
390198,1048977,2012-03-27,1954273,Bella Magdeline,Rita was wonderful  and gave us a very pleasant warm welcome. She treated us like royalty not just guest. I guess she just became our mother. She made us feel like part of her family in her cosy pad. The atmosphere and the place were worthwhile. We had our own privacy and she made sure that we enjoy the holidays by giving us our space and freedom of her home. She know her story because she gave us all the information we needed about things to do and places to go  reasonable places to go for lunches and dinners.My son enjoyed every minute of the stay and wanted us to stay for another week. The pad is closer to everything from the beach to most land marks in Cape Town and it is in the lovely crime free surbub of Sea Point with a beautiful view and the smell of the ocean. I will definately recommend to anyone who wants peace and quietness after spending the days out doors.
390198,3178548,2012-12-29,1399932,Lucia,I am so grateful to Airbnb for giving me the chance to meet Rita and stay at her beautiful place. I could not have dreamt of a better host and house for my stay in Cape Town.  Ritas beautiful house is  in my view  in the best possible location  and the view from its terraces is simply stunning. The room is lovely  and Rita is a marvelous person. She was very discreet and respectful from the very beginning she gave me the warmest hospitality and the most precious advice and tips she gave me privacy if I wanted privacy  and kept me company over a glass of wine if I needed company. She really made me feel at home.  It was extremely sad for me to leave my new friend and her house. I already look forward to my next stay.
800623,50368443,2015-10-11,1200633,Ruth,Fabulous host and spectacular house  sitting above Glen Beach in Camps Bay with amazing sea views. Marie-Louise is an exceptional host and the house is completely equipped with everything you need. Simply superb.

390198,20674976,2014-10-03,16006264,Lollie,This was my first Airbnb experience and Rita was such a delight and joy to be with She kindly greeted me after 24 hours of travel and arriving quite late at night. The room and accomodations were very clean and comfortable.  Rita went above and beyond as a host. She even invited me to a local show and a night out with a friend of hers which I enjoyed very much.
390198,27482308,2015-03-05,28466492,Natalie,Great place  great location  lovely Rita  highly recommended from our side

800623,160525001,2017-06-14,6401202,Neil,Unbeatable location  highly professional service
800623,238205971,2018-02-25,48357792,Shaun,Stunning property in a great beach location with a fantastic host - we couldnt have asked for more.  Parking on the street outside was absolutely no problem.  Would definitely use again
800623,241683440,2018-03-10,56957593,Ramin,Mary Louise is a perfect host. Great accommodation  great location in a safe area. I can only recommend this accommodation to anyone. Only two footsteps away from the beach. Also great for families. We would come back.
800623,302040575,2018-08-05,57728360,Daniel,Extremely well located home penthouse with lovely views and access to one of the best small beaches in Cape Town
800623,304178760,2018-08-09,715706,Kasia,This property is fantastic. I fell in love with the house and the view. Definitely recommend it to everyone. There was a slight confusion at the check in but everything was sorted out swiftly. I'm already planning another trip to Cape Town
800623,314181359,2018-08-26,62736649,Aulden,What an awesome place
800623,322817153,2018-09-14,70876877,Anne,This place is in an amazing location  so close to the beach and also to the main area of Camps Bay for walking to the restuarants and shops. Also waking up and having the ocean as your first view was great.Mary Louise was there to meet us and ease of booking in was great. The penthouse was easily big enough for two couples  it was clean tastefully decorated  and having a maid to do the laundry was a bonus  the only downside is there are stairs  lots of   going down to the apartment  so bear this in mind when booking. Also trying to organise taxis from there was a bit of a mission would suggest pre booking or walking down to the Camps Bay main area and picking one up from there. Would definately reccommend this place.
800623,335514664,2018-10-12,133725010,Katrin,The location  the apartment  the help from Mary Louise could not be better
390198,57637217,2015-12-28,22962769,Julie Olivia,Rita was an incredible host. We immediately felt at home and relaxed at Ritas house. The flat is pefectly located  close to the sea  a short taxi ride from water front and right in the middel of Sea point. We wouldnt live any where else than at Rita's if we came back to Cape Town. Would 100 procent recommend Rita as host and Cape Town to everyone
390198,58775891,2016-01-05,40946965,Lara,Rita promised fabulous views  but we got so much more. Especially a fun and kind host with lots of info for us about the city. We will make sure to stay with Rita again when we come back to Cape Town as soon as possible .
390198,60895001,2016-01-29,18448211,Miriam,Rita was an amazing host. We stayed there for 5 nights and loved it The location is great and Rita made us feel home immediately. I am so glad I found this gem of an airbnb stay Rita gave us very helpful recommodations  so we had the best pizzas at an Italian restaurant. It was also really nice chatting with her. She is just a lovely person. I definitely wanna come back
800623,349744511,2018-11-18,7259639,Lorenza Anna,Mary-Louises house is an hidden gem in Glen beach. Nestled in the trees  it offers direct access to the beach and breathtaking views of the ocean. House was spotless and bed linen crispy and freshly cleaned. Communication was easy and smooth. Highly recommended.
800623,350764747,2018-11-20,192424813,Daniela,Eine wunderschne stilvoll eingerichte Wohnung mit einer unschlagbaren Aussicht und dierektem Strandzugang. Der Abschied viel sehr schwer Gerne wieder
800623,355447849,2018-12-04,5282468,Paul,Amazing place. Located right on the water in Glen Beach  a short 5 minute walk into Camps Bay   with some of the best views in the world. The house itself is super clean  modern and has everything you could possibly need. Daily cleanings by the staff were a nice unexpected touch. Communication was quick  easy and smooth. Overall  this property exceeded our expectations
800623,356952368,2018-12-09,3270583,Paola,We really enjoyed our time here. The location was beautiful and the views from Mary-Louise's place cannot be beat. We really enjoy cooking and found the kitchen to be well stocked and organized. Having the daily cleaning service was also a pleasure. We appreciated that they were flexible on the time of cleaning as we did not want cleaners there in the morning while we were relaxing. The bed and shower were both excellent too.
800623,358407701,2018-12-14,63928817,Jessica,Just so perfectly situated  the property is literally on the beach. Waking up and falling asleep to the sound of the waves was a real treat. All amenities were brilliant  it was a stylish home from home and ideal with our two young children.
800623,363610842,2018-12-29,165114727,Oreoluwa,The location of this house is amazing. You're practically on the beach and could just walk down anytime. There's clean towels and linen  the hosts are absolutely fantastic people and i wish i stayed longer.
800623,366679998,2019-01-03,70009528,Martijn,Zeer mooi gelegen  altijd wat te zien qua uitzicht  huis om ook vaak thuis te blijven ontspannen  boekje lezen  barbecuen en mensen op het strand kijken. Leuk en stijlvol ingericht. Uitzicht slaapkamer fantastisch.
800623,367187398,2019-01-04,23022147,Christian,Amazing place with amazing views right on the beach. And if that is not enough you also have a super host that attends to your every need. Thank you again Mary-Louise for our wonderful stay.
800623,368069930,2019-01-06,45530574,Cilliers,Best location  on the beach.
800623,402106810,2019-01-17,221987061,Polly,A real treat
800623,403979188,2019-01-22,39306001,Kristina,Traumhaftes Haus  mit tollem Ausblick und guter Ausstattung.
800623,410404494,2019-02-10,116244605,Jacquelyn,This beach house is in a fantastic location within walking distance to everything we needed in Camps Bay. We walked to breakfast  lunch and dinner and took an Uber when we were traveling to a local winery and steak house. The views from the home are absolutely spectacular and beach access is at your doorstep. We were sad to leave and we will be happy to return. Thank you ML
800623,418415666,2019-03-02,169248847,Rina,The most stunning location in Camps Bay with the sound of the waves. Lovely sunsets
800623,419579436,2019-03-04,245780991,Christian,Tolle Location an einem einzigartigen Ort - aber mit ein paar kleinen negativen Aspekten Fr ber 500 00 Euro pro Nacht mussten wir feststellen das dieses Objekt ein paar Tage lter ist als die Fotos versprechen. Die Kchenausstattung ist leider unzureichend  1 Topf und 1 Pfanne  fr uns als leidenschaftliche Selbstversorger einfach zu wenig. Der Grill war fr unseren Geschmack und das geplante BBQ nicht einzusetzen  der Standort ist auch unangenehm in Anbetracht des Zustandes und der Sauberkeit. Wir verbrachten zwei Tage dort und am zweiten Tag war relativ viel los  obwohl wir alleine waren htten sein sollen waren immer wieder unterschiedliche Leute auf dem Grundstck  das strt natrlich die erhoffte Privatsphre. Der Zustand des Gebudes ist im allgemeinen sicherlich gut aber hier wre Bedarf einiges zu renovieren und aufzufrischen. Unsere Kritik ist konstruktiv zu sehen und keinerlei Vorwurf  wer jedoch 500 00 Euro pro Nacht zahlt wrde uns Stand heute zustimmen. Der Reinigungsservice  da es keine Waschmaschine gibt ist leider ein Witz  die Wsche kam am Tag unserer Abreise wieder- also vorsichtig wenn man etwas am gleichen Tag braucht Die Location ist toll und die Gastgeberin mehr als herzlich - das steht auer Frage
800623,421826692,2019-03-10,23390230,Hind,Wonderful house and wonderful host
800623,432530046,2019-04-04,211105697,Holger,Sehr schne Unterkunft  schnes Bad und sehr gute Ausstattung. Der Platz auf dem Balkon ist sensationell. Das Meer war deutlich zu hren  tagsber super  nachts mussten wir uns erst daran gewhnen. Wir knnen diese Unterkunft auf jeden Fall empfehlen.
800623,469873790,2019-06-15,48575042,Dan,Amazing place right on the water with great views   A great space.  Very clean  well equipped.  Would definitely stay there again.
800623,470344086,2019-06-16,42369786,Elizabeth,What a fabulous place And the location is unbeatable.  We cannot wait to come back.
800623,489243833,2019-07-16,144947874,David,Great location and amazing apartment. We loved it
800623,519345162,2019-08-28,26379802,Bettina,This is all about location The view from the terrace and from the master bedroom and shower is unbelievable Cant say anything negative. Communication was always quick and easy. We would definitely come back
800623,520985519,2019-08-31,237372603,Thamie,Peace of mind
800623,552271614,2019-10-21,60576906,Caia,Fantastic location and beautiful space. Really close to restaurants but also very private. Highly recommended.
800623,566995904,2019-11-21,6596969,Abbey,Mary Louise is a super host for a very good reason. She is a super host. Nothing was too much trouble. I would highly recommend the beautiful appartment right on glen beach which was sheer heaven. She went above and beyond to help us and was always at the end of the whats app.
800623,574460960,2019-12-08,113121338,Cole,This house is absolutely amazing I truly believe it is the best location in all of  Cape Town. It is very rare to actually have a house on the beach rather than having to cross many streets. The house is right in the heart of the best beaches and restaurants. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
390198,61354468,2016-02-03,41313106,Saiqa,Rita was very accommodating and friendly. A great host She gave us great advice on restaurants and places to see. The location was perfect  as it was situated near the ocean  a good street with nightlife. Very close to the red bus tour stop. I would recommend it to people who are looking for a place of rest while discoverying Capetown.
390198,68009207,2016-04-01,13090385,Rigard,I really loved staying here. The flat is in an incredible location with a balcony all round the outside of it looking straight at the mountain on the one side and snatches of the sea on the other - truly beautiful as the hang gliders come off of the mountain in the mornings. The room is comfortable  the flat is spacious and airy and Rita was a very easy host to chat with or let me do my own thing. The sea is about a minute walk from the flat with the stunning Sea Point promenade for walking  cycling and eating ice-creams. I highly recommend this place.
390198,68818272,2016-04-06,43370679,Celine,When I first got into the elevator I felt like I was Charlie about to discover the chocolate factory as the button to get to the top floor where the apartment is located is separated from the other ones  and when I actually got there a way more charming version of Willy Wonka was there giving me this warm welcome. Rita is the absolute perfect host  if you want privacy that's what you'll get  and if you want to have a chat and maybe share a glass of wine she made me discover this gorgeous south african red wine cold pinotage you will have a lovely easy going person to talk to. The apartment is super cozy and well located to discover all the amazing things Cape Town has to offer  and the area is very safe. Equipped with all the appliances  private bathroom  towels  wi fi which here is particularly fast compared to most places in South Africa  tea and coffee  hairdryer if you need one like I did  washing machine and a beautiful balcony overlooking the sea on one side and the lion heads on the other. Shame I was here only for 5 days. I will definitely come back on my next stay in Cape Town
390198,73232531,2016-05-07,10983299,Caroline,I would like to thank Rita for the amazing stay. I really enjoyed every moment of it. Her apartment is just stunning  and she is a wonderful relaxed host. You feel immediately at home Thanks Rita
390198,108422947,2016-10-16,83730916,Mottez,Rita was so helpful on everything . Very nice view . Nice and clean room . Good location .   I would love to stay there again .
390198,112871415,2016-11-08,22754065,Gary,Could not have been better. Bright  with stunning views  wrap around terrace. Top floor  VERY quiet. One block away from beach and restaurants. Rita was great at communicating in advance and made me feel completely at home though out the stay. Without a doubt I will be back again
390198,123171449,2016-12-27,9502382,Carola,Rita is a lovely person and we felt really comfortable in her flat with the beautiful balcony and view. The apartment is very clean  near to the coast  restaurants and bus stations. We felt save and it was a pleasure to spend time with her cats. We would always recommend this place and choose it again.
390198,129934410,2017-02-03,8979997,Regine Und Mario,Die Unterkunft ist etwas besonderes Zentral  aber doch ruhig und sicher gelegen.Man kann fulufig und mit den guten ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln einschlielich UBER die Stadt erkunden und genieen.Alles sehr sauber  nette Unterhaltungen mit der Gastgeberin und ihren Gsten. Ich habe mich wie zu Hause gefhlt. Die Katzen haben ebenso dazu beigetragen. Ich wrde jederzeit wieder bei Rita buchen  wenn ich in Kapstadt bin.
390198,136058684,2017-03-08,4192585,Scarlet,Rita's flat is beautiful and light with fantastic views of the mountains and glimpses of the sea the seafront promenade is a two minute walk away. The central shopping area can be reached by foot or by bus along the front. The flat has a nice balcony to sit out on and enjoy the view. Everything was clean and tidy and very comfortable. The flat is long and the guest bathroom  the lounge and kitchen are next to the bedroom  so it almost feels like an entire home to yourself. The best thing is Rita is very welcoming and even though I was not in the flat much as I was visiting friends nearby  it was very nice to chat with Rita when I saw her. The check in and out was smooth and communication was great throughout. Highly recommended
390198,147861379,2017-04-29,24291738,Gunilla,Rita is just EXCELLENT. I've so much enjoyed my stay. The apartment is wonderful  the location great. The cats adorable and Rita is a five-star host. Warmly recommending this stay to all airbnb-guests I will definitely be back if I can.
390198,216141809,2017-12-03,152986866,Jenny,Jag kunde inte ha bott bttre. Det r som ett 5-stjrnigt hotell fast bttre. Lgenheten r vldigt fin och har en fantastisk utsikt. Smakfullt och rent och Rita har tnkt p det dr lilla extra  som t ex en hrlig frottbadrock och badhanddukar fr stranden och s har man en egen sittplats p balkongen dr man kan sitta och njuta av utsikten. Hade turen att bli bjuden p hennes goda mat ocks. Kan varmt rekommendera detta boende.
390198,218122699,2017-12-11,456996,Anja,One of the best airbnb experiences I have ever had  thats why I ended up staying longer than expected. The flat and your room is very nice with fabulous views to table mountain and the sea. You even have a huge balcony for yourself. Seapoint is one if the nicest and best locations in Cape Town  with Uber you can get anywhere else easily. Rita is a super host and really nice and interesting person to spend time with. Hope I can come back for my next trip to Cape Town.
390198,224729955,2018-01-04,47929795,Raul,Rita is such a nice lady  welcoming and laid back. Her apartment is so well located in SeaPoint. She makes you feel at home and was always caring about me having a good time in Capetown. Also gave me some great tips and she is a very good talk too.
390198,226937218,2018-01-13,99396544,Sonja,Rita is an extraordinary host. She's funny and easygoing and most of all very hospitable. I felt immediately at home with her and the two cats. Her apartment and the guestroom is outstanding. The views from the balcony to the sea and to the mountains are just beautiful either for your morning coffee or for a coup of wine in the evening. The room is very clean  light and cosy with all amenities in the kitchen and bathroom you'll need. The location of her home is perfect for strolls to the ocean promenade and in general very centrally located.  Rita invited me to some events with her friends and family. I experienced exceptional moments I could never have had in a hotel  so this was an AirBnB experience at its best. Highly recommended without any doubt
390198,231649896,2018-02-02,169641918,Gez,Lovely penthouse flat  very safe and secure with fantastic views from every angle especially table mountain and lions head. Rita is a lovely lady and nothing was too much trouble. I will certainly be staying with her again in the future
390198,360631195,2018-12-21,131914015,Penny,Rita shares her warm hospitality and caring nature.  I really enjoyed staying in this fabulous flat in a great location  Everything was tip top wonderful  Highly recommended stay for all
390198,363235118,2018-12-28,229093366,Sherry,Rita is a so nice lady. She is very kind  and gave me a lot of good and useful suggestions. If I have time to go there again  will choose this place again. Looking forward to see you next time
390198,366160886,2019-01-02,168113780,Shaka,Rita was extremely welcoming and made me feel right at home. Ok b pic my best stays in cape town. Would highly recommend her to anyone. Thank you Rita
390198,369061607,2019-01-09,207068088,Natalia,Rita is super cool and with a wonderful sense of humor  great host  two adorable cats is a great plus The place is just stunning with magnificent views on the ocean from one side and Table Mountain and Lion's Head from the other side. Great location  I absolutely recommend and would love to come back again soon
800623,594754906,2020-01-19,119717120,Francois,.
800623,605269299,2020-02-14,14840244,Ali,This is a beautiful  bright  sunlight condo in the best location for Cape Town. We loved the thoughtfully decorated space. My 5 year old LOVED being able to walk down to beautiful Glen Beach  rinse off in the pool  and then play in the spacious living room. My parents and I loved sipping a glass of wine on the deck  overlooking stunning vistas of the ocean. The location made it easy to grab breakfast and dinner at the Camps Bay trip. And we were within 10 minutes to Table Mountain  just 20 minutes to downtown waterfront  and 20 minutes to Constantia wineries. I highly recommend this spot We were there on a weekday  so avoided the loud party scene. I do wonder if it might be loud on weekends But again  I would good back 100x if I could
390198,524696997,2019-09-06,24157240,Tessa,Rita's place is brilliantly located in an area that feels very safe to walk around and has plenty of shops and restaurants. The city centre is about 10 - 12 minutes away in an Uber  and the stop for the hop-on-hop-off sightseeing bus is about a 2 minute walk. The apartment itself is comfortable and well appointed  with a wrap-around balcony to views every bit as amazing if not more so as the photos suggest. The best thing about Rita's place though  is Rita herself. When I arrived she was so welcoming and thoughtful about what a weary traveller needed. Subsequently  she had lots of useful tourist tips  and we had some really interesting conversations that gave me greater insights into contemporary South Africa. Thoroughly recommended.
390198,593234846,2020-01-15,3478186,Bjorn,I had a very pleasant stay in Ritas well-kept and sunny apartment where I particularly enjoyed relaxing on the terrace with a magnificent view over Lions Head and Table Mountain. The location was also convenient with lots of restaurants and stores in the neighborhood and easy access both to central town and the beaches. Rita herself was a warm and generous host who made you feel at home and also provided advice and insights about Cape Town. Highly recommended

800623,702915846,2020-10-23,113890282,Mercy,Beautiful place. Wonderful host. Perfect location
800623,708643183,2020-11-14,46694676,Atang,My wife and I had a fantastic time at MLs place. The penthouse is practically on the beach with a breathtaking view of Glen Beach  is walking distance to restaurants in Camps Bay and was more than spacious for the two of us. Checking in and out was seamless and ML was incredibly responsive. We had the unfortunate experience of a burglary while there as a result of not locking one of the sliding doors and ML  her husband and the police were incredibly responsive. Despite the burglary  we had the relaxed holiday we were looking for and would highly recommend this place We will surely visit again whenever in Cape Town

800623,717079639,2020-12-21,45060407,Shamiema,Everything was amazing  it is a must see as the view from both bedrooms are beautiful. The architectural design and final touches truely  shows a lot of thought and care when into creating this little haven where u can spend a beautiful and memorable time with your partner.The sunsets  close access to the beach  and even the surprise of seeing dolphins is only a few of the things this little place has to offer. My stay was definitely too short so Im sure I will see you again.
800623,738900185,2021-03-14,203965731,Cesar,Lots of superlatives here.

The apartment with its huge balcony offers 360 degree views of the mountains and the sea all the way to Robben Island. One has always the choice between sun and shade depending on the time of the day. Parking my car on the street turned out to be no problem at all  it was very safe. Dish washer and washing machine were very welcomed amenities to have. There was nothing I didn't like.

390198,1002699359805497920,2023-10-15,276792450,Susanne,I only stayed 9 days in Ritas lovely home. The time passed unfortunately much too fast. From the first moment I felt at home. Rita created a welcoming atmosphere. The apartment was very clean  safe and quiet. I loved the decor. Everything was perfect. My bedroom was well organized with wardrobe  enough hangers  chest drawers etc. The bed was very comfortable. From the bedroom I could go directly to the balcony with a fantastic view. It was great. I could use her kitchen and the living room. The apartment had a perfect location. I went by foot or bus in the city. Nearby there were a lot of good restaurants and supermarkets. The best of the surroundings was the beach promenade. Rita is a very friendly  amazing and reliable person. She is a positive and lively person  as well as openminded. I dont speak English very well  but Rita responded to me and made conversation. She gave me valuable tips. If I had a question  she answered prompt. She was very thoughtful. Thank you
390198,1014396520176848093,2023-10-31,28781846,Annabel,Ritas home is perfect for those who want to live near the city but also take long walks by the sea  play with adorable cats  and cohabitate with a thoughtful  kind and funny host.

395538,4095038,2013-04-09,4859569,Yemisi,We had a wonderful vacation is April 2013.  Hiske was very responsive to our questions  and the apartment was beautiful  just as described.  We couldn't have asked for a better location  and were missing no amenities that we needed to make our stay comfortable.  I would definitely stay at Kushi again
395538,9223521,2013-12-15,4297106,Franck And Joshua,This apartment is just amazing We were completely surprised at the size  unparalleled views and splendor of this very urban chic apartment. The location is perfect  right in the middle of Cape Town. We travel several times per year for work and this apartment has been our best stay in years WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
395538,59115123,2016-01-07,43288983,Joe,Hiske's penthouse apartment in Cape Town is absolutely stunning and boasts spectacular views of the city  table mountain and the lions head. The apartment is very urban chic  extremely spacious and is situated right in the middle of Cape Town. We couldn't have asked for anymore I would highly recommend this to anyone interested. We will be back
395538,138123361,2017-03-19,49765059,Daisy,Very responsive and sent a message as soon as the apartment was booked. Hiske answered all the questions and was a great host  communicative and helpful. Check in and out was seamless  they really took good care of you. The location is in middle of the city  busy but absolutely secure and surrounded by attractions and eating places. The view is quite stunning from the high-rise apartment and it cannot get any better than that. Clean  spacious and the bedrooms in the loft are delightful. Would absolutely stay there again. Thank you
395538,223985986,2018-01-02,95255316,Reuben,Hiske's place is a real gem and offers great value for money. With access to amenities like a basic gym and the whole of the city bowl at your doorstep  it offers a lot. The apartment is beautiful inside and the building is safe and secure. Access to beaches  the Waterfront and other popular spots is simple but requires the use of an Uber. The most incredible part are the views from the penthouse. I have stayed all over Cape Town and the views of Table Mountain and Lion's Head from every room are spectacular.
800623,875960224920244348,2023-04-23,120002828,Omar,Such an awesome stay The house has a beautiful view of the beach. We were very comfortable and it definitely made our visit to Cape Town all the more special.

800623,947650016939784977,2023-07-31,121840633,Rachel,Fantastic house right on the beach with amazing views. Easy drive along to Cape Town. Host very easy to communicate with and very helpful. The washing machine drier are not in the upstairs appartment itself do laundry was done for us.

800623,995535998239897154,2023-10-05,220287121,Georg-Friedrich,Es war eine tolle Unterkunft. Lediglich bei der Adresse hatte uns das Navi im Stich gelassen. Hier sollte man wirklich nochmals alles berprfen. das Video zur Wegfindung war sehr hilfreich.
800623,1041875341933624071,2023-12-08,425355731,Lauren,It was an absolute small piece of paradise. The hosts were extremely communicative and the apartment was beautiful It was perfectly cleaned every day and we could not have asked for a better place to celebrate our honeymoon.
800623,1073060257258524289,2024-01-20,381817034,Vanessa,We absolutely loved our stay and did not want to leave. We are already discussing coming back next year The pictures dont do the place justice The location is unbelievable and the sound of the ocean along with its views are extraordinary
800623,1086865079713290865,2024-02-08,105887293,Bianca,The place is situated in a beautiful spot along the beach  The sounds of the waves sets off a beautiful melodic pattern.  Beautiful views and walking distance to the restaurants  I would 100 percent recommend to friends and family
800623,1088947964109729866,2024-02-11,244364197,Lowri,Penthouse was amazing. absolutely incredible view and very central to camps bay. Very responsive to questions  queries and proactively reached out. One of the best Ive stayed in

800623,1181104940623099528,2024-06-17,133271792,Andy,Couldnt be a more perfect spot to enjoy Camps Bay.  Extremely well appointed  comfortable  right on the Glens Beach.  Felt safe the whole time.  Excellent dining options 5 min walk.  Will def stay again.
801953,23543472,2014-12-04,10824658,Gnter,Es hat alles wunderbar geklappt  ich wrde immer wieder buchen. Das Appartement  sowie die Eigentmer des Appartements haben uns sehr nett empfangen. Die Lage des Appartements ist super  das Appartement auch. Alles sauber und rein  so wie man es mchte und gerne hat.
801953,23834146,2014-12-12,20811269,Grant,My girlfriend and I stayed in the apartment for 5 nights. The jost was excellent welcomed us in and showed us around as well as provided us with some great insight into the area and a fantastic spot to eat the first night as we arrived. The apartment has an incredible view  and is relaxing with a beatiful pool and area to braai. The unit is within walking distance to the main street in greenpoint and the VA waterfront. It is also centrally located for all the attractions that Cape Town has to offer. The unit was well decorated and well looked after and was exactly as advitised. I would recommend this unit to others as well as stay there again on my next Cape Town trip.
801953,44000616,2015-08-23,2441497,Nikhil,We had a great time staying at this apartment -- the place was very clean and spacious  with wonderful views of the ocean. The weather was unfortunately a little too cold to allow us to use the balcony or the pool much  but we can only imagine how enjoyable our stay would have been had the weather been warm to let us use these amenities. Colleen  the owner  was available to let us in and answer questions and even offered to give us a ride into town if we needed it. The apartment is perhaps a ten minute walk away from restaurants in Sea Point and is perhaps a half hour from the Waterfront. The neighborhood is lovely during the day but exercise some caution at night if walking alone or in a couple -- as is true in most areas of Cape Town. We had a great time staying here.
400107,3740042,2013-03-10,4431227,Vivian,Shirley's villa is an absolute haven. It is steps away from the beach and numerous restaurants. The bedrooms are all large and spacious. The kitchen is clean  and she keeps it well stocked with the basic seasonings. Upon arrival  Shirley even greeted us with milk  fresh bread and hot cross buns. It was fabulous Virginia comes on a daily basis and keeps the house very clean. She even helped with laundry We truly enjoyed our stay here and were very sad to leave.
400107,9379964,2013-12-25,8859866,Mark  Nancy,Absolutely wonderful place.  Five Spacious private bedrooms ensuite.  Courtyard garden with small pool for relaxing.  Very beautiful home with a lived-in feel to it.   Pleasantly decorated.  Walking distance to restaurants and shops only one block away.  Beach is only one block away.  Perfect location for spending the day without having to drive. I highly recommend this place.  And Shirley is a gracious host and easily accessible to answer any questions.
400107,28773797,2015-03-30,13184896,Pa,Shirley was very helpful when we arrived and she explained accommodation and surroundings in a good way. The villa match well with the description and the little garden with the pool was well used even if it only took a few minutes to walk to the beach.
801953,48307453,2015-09-25,19589479,Otto,Nice place  great location  would stay again.
801953,49316511,2015-10-03,5887032,Oreste,The place was very nice  great neighborhood  and it had beautiful views
801953,52058456,2015-10-26,41268304,Carolyn,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this gorgeous apartment. It was warm   inviting and we immediately felt at home. The views were spectacular  exactly as the photos. The apartment had everything we needed for an exceptionally comfortable and enjoyable stay. We also made the most of the great location close to the waterfront. Roy was accomodating and organised for us to be met at the apartment when we arrived. Would definitely come back and stay again.
801953,60296934,2016-01-21,6522969,Ann,We spend the best 4 days in this super nice  quiet and cosy apartment of all our holidays in Cape Town. The apartment has an incredible view  and is relaxing with a beatiful pool and area to braai. The unit is within walking distance to the main street in greenpoint and the VA waterfront. It is also centrally located for all the attractions that Cape Town has to offer. We would love to come back next year and I would also recommend this lovely apartment to everyone
801953,64792399,2016-03-08,12959432,Petr,The appartment is very conviniently located close to all atractions in Cape Town. Pool and nice view over the city is a plus.
801953,79121689,2016-06-11,56274715,Crystal,The Ocean View apartment was the best place we ever stayed The apartment was perfect for our 8 day stay in Cape Town. The apartment is centrally located - about 10-15min by car from all of Cape Town's major attractions VA Waterfront 10min by car  10min from Table Mountain  15min from Kirstenbosch Gardens  10min to Camps Bay  etc. Our hosts were amazing - so helpful and kind. When we arrived we were greeted by Colleen and had a great convo about places to see and recommendations for places to eat The Ocean Basket 5min away is awesome and help with making reservations at a spa and restaurants. She was only a what's app away from any question or help that we needed. The apartment is exactly as pictured and described. The bed was so comfortable and the temperature in the room was pretty stable and there was an ACheater unit that we didn't need to use but if you wanted could make the room cooler or warmer as needed. The apartment was spotless on arrival and kept that way by daily servicing. The kitchen is fully equipped with the necessary cookware and the grocery store is just minutes away. We would have breakfast most mornings out on the balcony overlooking the ocean. There is also a grill available to cookout next to the pool. We visited in the late autumnearly winter so it was too cool to play in the pool. The shower and tub are separated from the toilet and there was plenty of hot water. I would definitely recommend this apartment to all travelers We plan on coming again next year
801953,84195127,2016-07-06,26498924,Philip,A really amazing place which felt so much like it was my own little home in Cape Town. A beautiful view on a very quiet street. Very much recommended
801953,116603735,2016-12-02,3198796,Dominique,Great location  had a wonderful stay at this apartment. The host was very friendly and I would absolutely advise everyone to stay here. Will be back
801953,120555049,2016-12-11,103276185,Jan,The guesthouse was lovely as well as the patio  which was just ours during our stay.  I liked the lounge chairs  sun umbrella  and view.  The pool was nice  but I didn't realize it wasn't going to be too easy to use while we were there.  The kitchen was cute and functional  the bathroom spacious  and the bedroom comfortable.  The people who live in the main house were polite when we saw them and responsive when we needed them.  There was a fair amount of street noise  but overall we had a nice experience.
801953,125354459,2017-01-05,40030368,Peter,Super

400107,29540723,2015-04-09,14393693,Lisa,We had a gorgeous week in Shirley's very lovely and well appointed home. Magnificent location and everything you could want for a beachside holiday. Shirley was so warm and welcoming and left us a fridge full of goodies. Her lovely helpers Victoria and Virginia made sure we were very tidy and comfortable. I couldn't recommend Shirley more highly as a host.
400107,34418651,2015-06-08,30393916,Lena Velez,The villa was gorgeous  just fit for our needs  and the hostess has been helpful above all expectations when coordinating the arrivals of all the people staying there. Super place
400107,78386981,2016-06-06,31001824,Lavneet,The most beautiful home close to the beach and action at camps bay. With my immediate and extended family of 9 including the age group of 9 to 85   we had the perfect time. Thanks Shirley

400107,116125500,2016-11-27,20804631,Sandi,The villa is located perfectly in Camps Bay.  It is decorated with panache and is warm and inviting.  Very comfortable.  Every bedroom has an ensuite bathroom or a bath very close by.  Virginia and Victoria  the two maids could not be more helpful and kept the place looking beautiful.  We had a houseful and were constantly on the go so I know that was not easy.  We were there for our son's wedding and will be returning in the future.  If we come back with a group again this will be our go to place  Thanks  Shirley
400107,133855822,2017-02-25,20327651,Katie,Fantastic location  2 mins walk to beachshopsrestaurants. Very friendly host  Virginia was lovely and looked after us really well. Worked perfectly for us as a group of friends with 2 young children. Would definitely recommend staying here.
400107,145132162,2017-04-17,122492522,William,Central location in Camps Bay but just enough away from the promenade to feel like home. Shirley was a wonderful host and the home was perfect for families or large groups.
400107,149577691,2017-05-05,16901958,Ab,Had a great stay with my friends. House was great and we  had a very warm welcome. Staff was friendly as well.
400107,150103017,2017-05-07,74936914,Angel,Amazing We were a group of 8 women and 2 babies. Shirley made us feel so comfortable and cared for. Her house is beautiful and so close to everything you need  the beach  Table Mtn  shops  restaurants  and even the sight seeing bus. Great kitchen to cook and sitting areas to chat. Fast internet. She was able to help us with baby cots and a car seat. I would recommend this house for anyone wanting to stay in the Camps Bay or Cape Town area. She will make you feel loved
400107,171201667,2017-07-17,94244558,Jim,This home is exceptional.  Plenty of room  plenty of baths.  And really well decorated and equipped.  So it has a very warm  inviting feel of a true home.  It is also perfectly located within easy walking distance to the beach and all the restaurants and shops.
400107,218807985,2017-12-15,63853748,Alex,Great guesthouse  exactly as advertised. Huge bedrooms  great kitchen and large living space. Thoroughly cleaned by an excellent team every morning. Highly recommend
400107,223243555,2018-01-01,66944745,Nicholas,We cannot recommend this house highly enough for a large family group such as our own.  Camps Bay is a lovely part of Cape Town  moments walk to a great beach  yet an easy and cheap Uber anywhere in town.  One of our party did rent a car  and the secure parking was appreciated.  The house is comfortable in a way that there were always spots to be alone  or to gather as a large group.  The kitchen has everything you might possibly need  and we were a group of exacting cooks  with recipes for American  English  and metric measurements  but no problem.  Virginia  and housekeeper  was lovely and thorough  although due to our holiday schedule  we did not nor did we expect to see her every day.  Although there is no available washer and dryer on the property  Virginia happily took our laundry out for washing  drying and pressing.  Security is very good and attentive as we found when we returned to the system being on  and forgot to switch it off.  Not only did a burly armed guard arrive almost immediately  but Shirley also contacted us directly.  It was truly and delightful and unforgettable experience.
400107,232967685,2018-02-07,141201357,Craig,Location is outstanding for walking anywhere  Shirley was a gracious and responsive host and her villa was comfortable and well equipped.  We liked the touches of home and her hospitality.  I highly recommend this property looking for value  comfort and location
400107,253027043,2018-04-13,129839012,Fraser,Amazing villa in a great location. Will definitely be returning
801981,57523566,2015-12-27,38241726,Natashe,Tim and Julia's home was a wonderful place for our vacation.

801981,125905215,2017-01-08,46751811,Natacha,We had a wonderful time in Cape Town The house is lovely and beautifully decorated. We were impressed by the views of both the mountains and the bay. Tim was very attentive and gave us great advice about sightseeing. We arrived late at night  but he arranged someone to greet us and tell us the first basic things we needed to know. The location is really convenient  short drive to restaurants  shops and the beach. We would definitely recommend this place to other people.
801981,127529460,2017-01-19,34638295,Olivier,Maison trs agrable pour des vacances en famille  chaleureuse et cosy. Tres bien situe  Hout Bay   proche des commodits tout en tant dans un quartier trs calme. Tim avait tout parfaitement organis pour le cot pratique. Je recommande vivement ce logement.

801981,791798677067360955,2022-12-28,53662378,Peter,Beautiful and well equipped home with great views over Hout Bay and Signal Hill. Easy walking distance into Hout Bay centre and the beach. Refreshing pool and really nice to sit and relax on the terrace at the end of the day. Naueme was friendly and helpful and left the house looking immaculate.

801981,859946998047566164,2023-04-01,44853448,Katie,Hout Bay is great. Close to Cape Town  Camps Bay  Simons Town etc. Hout Bay has everything. Tims house is great especially if you have small children. Id really recommend for a family with young kids. The only downside is its next to a primary school  so can be noisy during school hours. I got used to the noise  and we were actually out a lot of the time anyway. You can walk everywhere from the house so location wise its great. Thanks for welcoming us into your home.
801981,866444516552060596,2023-04-10,363776265,Carolin,Vielen Dank  ein Zuhause wie fr eine Familie Alles vorhanden  was man bentigt. Wir haben leider nicht ganz so gutes Wetter gehabt  deshalb haben wir den PoolGarten gar nicht genutzt und anderweitige Ausflge unternommen.
801981,1053490450879111063,2023-12-24,349437284,Engin,Fantastische Unterkunft  in der wir uns sehr wohl gefhlt und den Urlaub umso mehr genossen haben.

801981,1066517886664697121,2024-01-11,22947796,Andreas,We are a family of four with two small kids aged 2 and 4 and for us the stay was perfect - with nothing to be missed. Communication from start to finish pro-active  friendly and helpful. Place exactly as described - very safe neighborhood with restaurants  cafes  shops and beach in walking distance and great starting point for adventures in and outside of Cape Town. Highly recommended
400107,444726089,2019-04-28,2701912,James,Couldnt have been any more ideal. An incredible space with everything you need  steps from the beach and beautiful Mountain views. Shirley was so thoughtful  quick to respond  she even baked us a cake See you next time
400107,508746917,2019-08-13,144571007,Matthew,There were many great things about this house.  First  the location we were less than a 2 minute walk from the following two grocery stores  ATMs  restaurants on the beach road  the beautiful Camps Bay beach  park for kids  etc.  However  as there is a block between the house and all of this but the park  it was quite at night.  As we had a rental  Camps Bay was also a great location to visit all Cape Town locations - from Cape Point to Kirstenbosch to VA.  Even getting to Hermanus was quite easy.  Second  the view  We could see Lion's Head from the front yard and the upstairs.  We could also see the 12 Apostles - and I believe the Western Table.  Gorgeous.  Third Virginia the househelp is one of the sweetest people we've met.  Her smile makes you want to smile  She's also so helpful if you have any needs and we had very few.  Fourth  the kitchen it was stocked with so much.  We had some good meals in there.  The stovetop is really  really nice.  There were French presses in every room and more to spare in the kitchen.  Fifth it felt more like a house than a hotel.  This was positive for us.  Sixth  it was comfortable from 2 ways of heating each room to the fire place to the couches the AC works great too - if you're there when it's warm.  Seventh  it had plenty of room for the 11 of us 7 adults and 4 children between the ages of 6-12.  Eighth  the secure parking it was enough for the big Toyota van we drove 10 seater.  That was great  It would be enough for two cars if you're not driving a car.  We parked the extra car we were 11 on the road - and there are guys out there who watch the cars.  Ninth washerdryer.  It was confusing because of one review - but there IS a washer and a dryer for clothes and they are large capacity.  Lastly  our hosts  Wow.  From booking to check-out  they were incredible quick to answer any and all questions and I asked a LOT.  They welcomed us with so much fruit  a red and white wine  bread  amazing cake  eggs  and so much more to enable us to eat upon arrival even before grovery shopping.  Keith wanted to make sure I knew where everything was  so walked with me to the two grocery stores and ATMs - which is above and beyond what is required.  One afternoon a window's alarm was having issues and Keith left work and came straight away to make sure everything was okay.  They were amazing.  I would love to give more details on this place and it's advantages  but it would be so specific that you could easily find the address which would be a privacy issue - and I respect Shirley and Keith too much for that.
400107,514519740,2019-08-21,240309238,Rhonda,Shirley was awesome She went above and beyond for my family with some of our special requests and needs  and her house is fabulous and its a short walk from the beach and restaurants.  Virginia was also awesome and very accommodating to my family and they both made our stay great.
400107,570704570,2019-11-30,281640821,Leri,The house was extremely well and thoughtfully equipped with everything one needs when living so close to the beautiful Camps Bay Beach. Virginia came in everyday to fully clean the whole house and even offered to do our washing. Shirley was always contactable and ready to help.
400107,523699701238664039,2021-12-23,103461915,Steven,Our large family had a tremendous stay The house is super cute  spacious  well-stocked  and  best of all  one block from the beach.

We were generously welcomed and attentively looked after. Shirley's felt like a home away from home. The welcome touches were very gratefully received and special touches like a packed beach bag in every room were above and beyond. Thank you Shirley and Virginia

And Shirley was kind and responsive throughouta wonderful host
400107,796144451612759209,2023-01-03,54485045,Hellen,Shirley was a great host and helped us in every possible way.   Her helper  Virginia was a lovely person and very helpful.

807366,26789448,2015-02-19,26468360,Adam,Michaela left the keys in a secure location for us so we never managed to meet but we were delighted with the way she prepared an information print out for us  and the lovely lovely house was clean and welcoming.

I never had the opportunity to meet Michael in person  but she was always in touch before  during  and after my arrival  and she went far beyond my expectations in helping with directions and recommendations  and even helped me with obtaining the ability to have international phone service while I was traveling.  The location was perfect and the most beautiful beach was just a few steps away.  I will be back
807366,29225046,2015-04-05,220288,David,Excellent hosting  perfect apartment and gorgeous location  to enjoy the sea and wonderful views of Cape Town. We were family with two little kids and we feel everything very easy roomy  well equipped kitchen  garden and safe neighbourhood

807366,727321338138514675,2022-09-30,79594482,Hanlie,We absolutely loved staying at Michaelas place. The access to the beach was super easy and we took many walks around the complex to the pools and to the restaurants just a few minutes away. The house has a wonderful warm soul  And even though we stayed there for a month we felt extremely at home and never tired of the sunny courtyard. We also used the outdoor Weber and indoor fireplace.  all in all we adore the place and Michaela is a fantastic host who was always willing to assist us.
810042,3428420,2013-01-28,4540222,Stina,The Pineapple Cottage was a perfect retreat in the Cape Town area  It is close enough to the action  but secluded enough for some peace and relaxation.  We loved being able to walk out and easily access the harbor  shops  restaurants  swimming pools  and hiking trails.  The cottage is quite big  with lots of room to spread out.  Because we stayed a week  we greatly appreciated the kitchen and laundry facilities.  The two outdoor patios are a bonus  The outdoor shower is very refreshing  and both bath and beach towels were provided.  The hosts are very friendly and accessible.   Parking was generally easy  but on the weekend be sure to have some Rand handy for the parking security  attendant.  We'd love to go back and spend another week or more at the Pineapple Cottage.
810042,61066990,2016-01-31,33702647,Kristel,What a lovely place to stay. Walking distance from all the main attractions in Kalkbay. Unit is equipped with more than enough to make for a comfortable stay. Feels like home.

810042,273707086,2018-06-07,69334761,Jenny,Accommodation gets five plus stars for everything from the view  to the space and Carol's availability. In winter its a bit chilly to shower outside  but I'm sure that in summer showering outside and looking up at the mountain would be an added bonus.
810042,426805955,2019-03-22,2121621,Margaret,Great location and lovely space

The cottage has a cosy  coastal charm  big rooms and lovely spaces to dine or relax in.

471729,23595999,2014-12-06,18715379,Nicole Brune-Gelardi,Ein wunderbarer Ort  ein wunderschnes Haus  tolle Gastgeber. Klein  fein und sehr  sehr liebevoll. Ruhe PUR Super Zeit. Danke Gregory
471729,23716440,2014-12-08,13237546,Esther,Warm welcome in Scarborough  Thanx for everything  your place is wonderful
471729,25602384,2015-01-20,4473072,Marie Laure,Nous avons pass une seule nuit dans ce superbe endroit et c'est bien notre seul regret  laccueil de Grgory a t trs chaleureux et nous nous sommes sentis trs bien dans ce beau cottage. Environnement extraordinaire  trs bel espace de vie  jolie chambre. Nous avons t ravis de ce moment . Nous esprons revenir pour plusieurs jours cette fois. Merci beaucoup 
471729,27136257,2015-02-26,2937901,Daniel,We stayed a bit over a week at this nice and secluded place in lovely Scarborough.  Well furnished and quite comfortable
471729,51309192,2015-10-19,24475744,Louisa,The listing was a bit misleading in that I understood from the photographs that there were sea views from the cottage. It was also listed as accommodating 4 people and having 2 beds - there was 1 bed and a settee with 2 mattresses on the side. This would be fine for 2 adults and 2 children  but not 4 adults. The hosts ask that you practice recycling and have provided appropriate bins. However  these do not get emptied nor did we know where we should place the recycling.
471729,54196190,2015-11-16,39109925,Christopher,We enjoyed two great nights in this cottage. It was very well equipped and clean. You could find everything you need was it spare sheets  sharp knives or even candles. The balcony view couldn't be any better and Gregory was extremely friendly. He showed us a secret way to the beach and made us feel very comfortable overall.
471729,56771546,2015-12-18,33351625,Patricia,We felt quite welcome when we met our hosts  who were friendly and hospitable. The location is lovely  and sitting on the deck reading a book  is not to be missed. So quiet  and loved not having a television.
471729,56906018,2015-12-20,33577283,Sabine,localisation parfaite pour dcouvrir la pninsule du Cap le logement trs agrable  tout confort dans un village tranquille o il fait bon sjourner vue superbe sur la nature sauvage  bruit des vagues car la mer est toute proche Gregory accueillant et disponible  recommander  tous
471729,58487754,2016-01-03,32948337,Angie,Lindiwe and Gregory made us feel welcome even before we arrived.  The cottage was exactly as pictured  so all our expectations were met. The views of the Cape nature reserve amazing and sunsets were magic.  We even got to see some wildlife  bontebok and cape zebra.  A family of guineafowl visited the garden every morning.
810042,568592777013524814,2022-02-23,81091043,Valeria,The Pineapple Cottage is so true to the images. It is big  spacious  plenty of space to work good wifi and to entertain guestsfriends for a nice Braai. It has great appliances and utilites and it is gorgeous. Set in a perfect location  next to the main road  with a view of the harbour and next to cafe olympia  great pastrycoffee place as well as restaurant. Carol is super available and communicative. Will make sure you are comfortable. She even met up with me sooner to hand over the keys as she wouldnt be there for an early check in. Overall great experience Thank you for having me
810042,573700376031040162,2022-03-02,11067989,Kate,Pineapple Cottage is a lovely open spacious holiday house. Its simplicity no frills is its charm  with character and lovely outdoor garden patios. Surprisingly peaceful  given the location on a busy road  and so convenient for local bakery  shops  restaurants and the Harbour. We have stayed in many different apartments and houses in Kalk Bay and this is one of the best.  However if you want high tech modern kitchen and bathroom this may not suit everyone. Carol is a lovely helpful hist - We will be returning
810042,613509741622791318,2022-04-26,455437637,Simon,Absolut empfehlenswert zentral. Platz zum Spielen fr unsere kleinen Kinder. Superliebe Gastgeberin.

471729,113489038,2016-11-13,25351205,Marco,We had a great stay in the cottage. Felt well rested The area was peaceful. Gregory made us feel welcome.
471729,134114317,2017-02-26,20445929,Mat,We stayed with Gregory and his friendly family for 5 nights and had an enjoyable stay. Scarborough is a very secluded town  the property very peaceful with a great pool facility and awesome braii area. The only downside we found the place  as a holiday let for the price  a little neglected. The outside light on the veranda didn't work  so we sat outside in darkness  quick fix....change the lightbulb. The sofa bed in the lounge was also broken. Luckily only our 3 year old boy slept on it so wasn't much of an issue but adults sleeping on it would be. All in all a pleasant stay but please think of a little maintenance from time to time.
471729,139972631,2017-03-27,121630516,Su,Nice  cosy cottage with amicable hosts. Had a great stay in beautiful Scarborough. Central  yet secluded.
471729,146551686,2017-04-23,26000780,Stefania,Thank you for having us stay at your beautiful cottage. We woke up to the view of the nature reserve just in front of the house  and fell asleep to the sound of waves. It is idyllic We will be back again in the future for sure. Thank you for your hospitality
471729,181790280,2017-08-13,15664039,Odelia,The apartment has sea view from the kitchen and the balcony  has lovely traditional decoration and is equipped with simply everything you need - including a braai.
471729,216703070,2017-12-05,155774649,Lesley,A quiet  lovely  friendly place This was the third time I've stayed. Home from home
471729,222537912,2017-12-30,2445015,Gideon  Eva Marie,Great location. Easy people. Quit surroundings. Great
471729,223983087,2018-01-02,2561591,Flore,If you are looking for an affordable place close to the beach 10 minute walk the cottage is perfect. Would recommend it for 2 persons rather than 4 as we felt a bit cramped. Loved the bathroom where you can spot different birds while taking a shower.
471729,225615624,2018-01-07,57484819,Michelle,Very peaceful spot in Scarborough. We relaxed and rested wonderfully A great start to our year

471729,242008215,2018-03-11,49760792,Louis-Robert  Philn,We were in need of peace and quiet and found it at Gregory and Lindiwe's place. They were friendly and helpful hosts and gave excellent suggestions on how to explore the local area. The cottage is comfortable with everything you might need for a longer stay. We were not eager to leave and would recommend the cottage as comfortable accommodation.
810042,795421852263961730,2023-01-02,211880974,Stuart,Beautiful period cottage in a great location just down the road from the main street in Kalk Bay. Great for people who appreciate old buildings and a peaceful atmosphere. Well equipped and comfortable
810042,823047055245008323,2023-02-09,276238762,Samantha,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Carol's cottagein Kalk Bay Carol was friendly and accommodated us with an early check in time. The area was fun to explore all within walking distance to the cottage. We loved the character of the cottage and beautiful garden area to have braai's outside. It was a very enjoyable and comfortable stay
810042,852006567321246294,2023-03-21,261839049,Marian,Thank you  Carol  for hosting us for a lovely stay. The decor and convenience of Pineapple Cottage lived up to our expectations for an holiday in our own city spacious  well located and charming. Our boy loved the feline visitor who he played with for hours. And we all loved the proximity to the harbour  tidal pools  art galleries  walks  the park  good coffee and bagels  and good curry We felt that you might want to tell future guests about the need to park in the street  in the advert.  You may very definitely see us again
810042,860752466975556497,2023-04-02,262860496,Marius,Amazing little cottage with an amazing garden in a beautiful location. And Carol is a great host who safely let us in when we were arriving late. Would come again any time.

810042,1052020032936761156,2023-12-22,473762768,Jimmy,Pineapple cottage is a lovely early 1900 cottage that still breaths that atmosphere but has all the 21st century features. Three different terraces with each its own distinct character. Its in close proximity of the harbour  restaurants  bars  beaches and the railway station. All that in one of the most vibrant places on the Cape peninsula.
810042,1084673611607101599,2024-02-05,150451533,Katrin,A wonderful flat  both private and close to a variety of shops and restaurants. Our toddlers 1 12 and 3 absolutely loved the space and the outdoor options. The outdoor shower was also an amazing and welcome plus in summer. The accommodation has both a gas cooker and power banks in case of load shedding and the kitchen is well equipped  both with spiced  as well as with equipment. The beds of very comfortable and the whole house is lovingly and tastefully decorated. Carol was a welcoming and helpful host and the fact that she lives next door and could help quickly gave us a great feeling of safety.
810042,1098482722768612010,2024-02-24,3945240,Sonya,Loved our time staying at Carols place. Beautiful home. Spacious  bright and clean. Very comfy beds and well equipped for load shedding. Three great little garden areas and outdoor shower. Also a big bath in the bathroom with was great for bathing our little one at the end of each day. Kitchen was stocked with tall the things you may need for cooking. Carol left some little treats for us on arrival which was really appreciated. Super easy to be in contact with and very helpful host. So close to all the restaurants in Kalk Bay and just a short drive to other great amenities and beaches. Would 100 recommend staying here. Didnt want to leave. Thanks so much again Carol.
810042,1102743668636634629,2024-03-01,90084746,Fraser,Fantastic welcome from Carol with many goodies left for us including coffee wine and biscuits. Cottage itself was beautiful with many original features - with special mention to the roll top bath and the stoop. We found everything we needed and appreciated the stove top kettle during load shedding Loved the outside hot shower and visits from the charming cat. Only minor downside  the proximity of the trains enthusiastically tooting in the mornings from 6am. Overall a truly delightful stay.

Amazing views  relaxing hammock and a lovely braai spot. Just a short walk to the beach along the edge of the reserve or walk to 'town' for coffee and restaurants.
471729,263904861,2018-05-13,94921651,Tanya,Wonderful peaceful home to stay in thank you. Would highly recommend Gregs place. Fantastic communication.

471729,405486464,2019-01-27,53433892,Kerri,We had a great  restful stay at Gregory and Lindiwe's charming cottage. The highlight of our stay was the refreshing salt pool and also the sunset and evenings out on the deck which has views of the sea and panoramic views of the mountains of the Nature reserve.  Because the two areas of the cottage are separated by a bathroom it also worked very well when once of us wanted to go to bed early and the other wanted to watch movies on their I pad in the lounge . The cottage has a wonderful original Scarborough home feel and felt very private too.
471729,412249572,2019-02-15,212629360,Thekla,Really cosy and comfortable place with amazing views. Very peaceful place  kitchen is very well equipped and nice to cook in -.

471729,430906026,2019-03-31,35896224,Finn,The place was amazing  super cute and had everything.
471729,517205880,2019-08-25,246345369,Brendon,Great private space close enough to the beach to walk to but far enough that the roar of the waves don't keep you up at night. Well designed living space  well stocked for easy self-catering. Great views from the bathroom window and a friendly Cape white eye greets you in the morning. WiFi signal very good. Place spotless. Definitely recommend.
471729,537157027,2019-09-28,258704562,Kumarie,Good place to stay in.

Ursula gave us great tips during our stay and for places to go along the Garden Route. She really made us feel at home If we will ever be in Capetown again  we will certainly check if her perfect apartment is available Lianne  Sander

811611,11788447,2014-04-15,4612018,Vas And Kavitha,We loved our stay in Ursula's charming apartment  located in a lovely and quiet neighborhood. The stay was very comfortable  and the private garden patio was perfect for sharing a glass of wine in the cool Cape Town evenings  or a hot cup of Rooibos tea that we found in the kitchen. A short walk from the apartment gets you to the heart of the city where there are lots of nice restaurants and bars. We walked back late in the evenings after dark  and felt quite safe. The apartment is easy to find  and there are plenty of spots to park your car in the street outside. Ursula is a wonderful host  and we will definitely stay at her apartment again if we visit Cape Town.
811611,12276030,2014-04-28,4005034,Meghan,Amazing house with a beautiful patio. Ursula was a great  friendly host with wonderful recommendations Perfect stay in Cape Town  can't wait to come back.

811611,14394923,2014-06-18,14699406,Kayla,It was all that we expected and more She was very helpful with information about the town and sites to see. She was very concerned about our comfort and wanted to make sure that we had a wonderful time in Cape Town. There were many restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood was nice and safe and the apartment was just perfect for us We loved it
811611,17108220,2014-08-07,17719227,Amy,Ursula was grand. Very accommodating from the moment we made the reservation to when we rang the bell and beyond. Though we arrived later at night she didn't mind. She wanted us to love cape town and we did So much to do and see but first you must have a great breakfast at Puka just a block away.

811611,18957630,2014-09-03,16910656,Jeremy,Ursula is a wonderful and gracious host. She made our staying warm and our accomodation was very clean and nice. We really enjoyed our staying in Cape Town with Ursula. Hope to come back once
811611,19302352,2014-09-09,20930205,Jaynie,Ursula was both friendly and informative. Her wonderful home in busy Cape Town was surprisingly peaceful and quiet  We loved our little cottage with its large private courtyard and felt completely safe and relaxed.  The cottage is perfectly situated - we walked everywhere  Thanks Ursula  we will definitely be back
811611,20099279,2014-09-23,16843990,Susann,My boyfriend and me had a wonderful stay at Ursulas apartment. It was very spacious  clean and cosy. You're living in a very calm and nice neighborhood  but at the same time very close to the city  which is great. We would love to come back some time
811611,20561035,2014-10-01,12419118,Megan,What can we say Our stay at 8 burnside lived up to all the fantastic reviews Ursula was a lovely and helpful host. We were lucky enough to book her for a day trip to Cape Point - and there's really nothing better seeing the sites with a guide who is flexible  experienced  and fun. The rooms and courtyard were as cute as advertised  in a great location. My sister and I loved walking to the Power and the Glory pub nearby for a coffee or wine  and the Millers Thumb for a cozy fish dinner. Our first trip to Cape Town will have lots of good memories and we definitely hope to be back. Highly recommend
811611,20644509,2014-10-03,18355879,Andrew,The property was located in an excellent spot Ursula was extremely nice and very willing to help us navigate around Cape Town. She provided several recommendations. We really enjoyed the property. It was tastefully decorated and comfortable. I would absolutely stay there again Just longer next time
811611,22156564,2014-10-31,22423734,Warren,Ursula was a great host. Gave us loads of info about various restaurants and things to do in town. The location was perfect for us  we walked around the local area during the day and in the evening  nice to use the car. Would recommend this place.
811611,22485267,2014-11-08,7104373,Andrea,We spent some days at ursulas place. The room was spacious and comfortable  the bathroom clean. We even could use the kitchen. The surrounding was safe and calm  although just some meters away from quirky long street with restaurants and bars. Ursula was very friendly and competent in giving us some useful tipps regarding our trip towards the garden route. She even proposed to be available to help us when on our way. We can recommend ursula really
811611,22607188,2014-11-10,709377,Megan,Absolutely perfect  I stayed for two nights with my friends three of us total and we loved Ursula's place.  It's comfortable  well-decorated  and the private patio is a treat.  Ursula stayed up to let us in even though we arrived past midnight and was extremely helpful with tips for what to do and how to get around.  It's walking distance to great restaurants  shops  yoga studios  and you get an amazing view of Table Mountain when you step out the door.  Except for when she let us in  we didn't see Ursula and the apartment was very private.  Can't wait to stay again - highly recommend.
811611,22795633,2014-11-15,22123576,Sophie,I stayed at 8 On Burnside with my parents for 5 nights. We felt at home straight away The place is awesome. It's new  clean and quality furniture. The outside 'patio' is wonderful for breakfast and gives you a great view of the Table Mountain Cable Way so you can check from the breakfast table if the cable way is running and plan the day accordingly. It's also perfect for a pre-dinner drink after a full day of explorations. The hostess is very friendly and has loads of inside tips to explore the city and get the most out of your stay I can only recommend it No regrets at all. See you again soon Ursula
811611,24227639,2014-12-23,20528583,Evelyn,Perfect Central Location and Ursula is a perfect host. Thx and Hope to u again -
811611,25056325,2015-01-05,2020295,Emily,Ursula's place was one of our favorite airbnb spaces we've ever stayed in Beautifully decorated  kitchen outfitted with everything you'd need  clean  comfortable  and fantastic walkable location Our time was too short - would definitely stay here again when back in Cape Town.
811611,25334593,2015-01-12,1929224,Brian,Ursula was amazing and her space was spectacular.   We had such a great stay and Ursula's hospitality was top notch.   Perfect location  super clean  very charming --- highly recommended
811611,25442507,2015-01-16,6479689,Els,Perfect and comfortable place to stay to explore Capetown and surroundings. And of you need any advice  Ursula is available
811611,25554399,2015-01-19,4367730,Erin,8 On Burnside was a wonderful place to stay. The place was clean  well-lit  very comfortable  and well stocked with pots  pans  microwave  range top  fridge  freezer  hairdryer  tea  coffee and fixings  extra pillows and blankets  etc.  etc. The outside patio was very pleasant. The place was very private  but Ursula was just a text away if you needed anything she even provided healing balm for my husband's hurt knee  and saved our laundry from blowing away when we left it out on a windy day. Ursula was more than happy to set up transport if needed  or to provide advice. Just ask  The neighborhood felt very safe and had nice restaurants and cafes within quick walking distance. There is street parking right outside the door.
811611,27123143,2015-02-26,3091151,Kristin,Das Appartement war wunderschn und in toller Lage direkt an der Kloof Street - die perfekte Ausgangslage fr Ausflge auch zu Fu Wir wurden herzliche empfangen und es war super sauber. Das Schlafzimmer hat alles was es braucht  bad und Kche sind ebenfalls toll eingerichtet und es war sogar Tee und Milch im khlschrank Ursula hat sogar fr uns gewaschen und spricht auerdem perfekt deutsch Vielen Dank fr einen perfekten und ruhigen Aufenthalt
471729,588137233,2020-01-04,26887827,StefanAnnheliza,Perfect place to explore a perfect little village
811611,28461288,2015-03-24,18814522,Tracy,We arrived a bit earlier than expected but hosts were ready for us. Showed us around the place and left us to explore the neighbourhood with informative booklet on our own. Lovely bright room  loved the bath after 21 day overland adventure tour. Great kitchen with all the facilities you desire. The place was wonderfully situated for quick access to Table Mountain  onoff city tour bus and laundromat. Loved the Blue Cafe Deli just up and around the corner - went there for breakfast every morning. They were very helpful in getting us on the Uber cab system which is excellent way to travel around Capetown. Great hosts  delightful rooms and courtyard. I would definitely stay there again if I was to return to beautiful Capetown... A great experience.
811611,28867524,2015-03-31,8203607,Fabienne,What a fantastic place to stay in Cape Town. Ursula is such a nice host and welcomed us even at 1 am as our flight was late. We felt like home. The area is great to live and the little backyard makes it very special.
811611,29072177,2015-04-03,21440174,Anja,We had a fabulous time at 8 Burnside. Ursula is a wonderful host full of useful tips how to best explore the area. The flat is as nice as the pictures show and superbly situated to easily explore the city and has nice restaurantscafes close by  also parking in the street was easy. We would definitely recommend to stay with Ursula at 8 Burnside
811611,29385616,2015-04-07,11648295,Anita,Ursula was warm and welcoming. Well equipped  comfortable accommodation in a fantastic neighbourhood Couldn't have asked for better
811611,29932031,2015-04-14,8013917,Chris,Great neighbourhood  great unit just as described  and we were made to feel most welcome. A wonderful introduction to Cape Town.
811611,30098311,2015-04-17,17455472,Graham,Great base for exploring an amazing city Location was perfect and the apartment was lovely.  Highly recommended
811611,30385181,2015-04-21,6282,Ryan,We had a lovely experience staying at 8 Burneside. It was perfect for a couple's two night stay and centrally located to downtown areas. Ursula was lovely and made sure we had everything we needed. On our way out she gave us advice about the wine country - it's a bonus that she's a travel guide too Would definitely stay here again without question.
811611,31033365,2015-05-01,21315612,Sarah,My home for the week surpassed my expectations.  Ursula was super knowledgeable and so helpful when I had to fly home for a family crisis.  The beautifully furnished apartment had absolutely everything I needed and was cosy and very secure.  I would recommend this home away from home to anyone.
811611,32877200,2015-05-23,21285060,Bill,Everything about Ursula and her accommodations were absolutely perfect.  The bedroom is spacious  the bath and kitchen were great  and everything beautifully appointed and decorated.  Ursula's recommendations for dinner were spot on -- do not even think about making your own restaurant choices when you have that kind of help  The place is an easy walk to everything Kloof street and there are two neighborhood cafes within two blocks -- both great.  Don't stay anywhere else  Ursula is warm and friendly and willing to share all of her extensive knowledge and recommendations about Cape Town and its surrounding area.  Like a personal unobtrusive tour guide who you would like to hang out with.  And I didn't even mention the private patio ...
811611,33477769,2015-05-28,4081325,MacKenzie,Beautiful little place to call home in walking distance to many shops and restaurants.
811611,34291891,2015-06-07,30594302,Sabrina,Ein wunderbarer Ort in wunderbarer Lage Gerne wieder.
811611,36086054,2015-06-25,26921123,Jan,We had a wonderful 3 days in Cape Town based at Ursula's perfectly placed apartment. Ursula was so welcoming and helpful and the place was lovely- beautifully decorated and spotless. I would highly recommend it as a place to stay and if we are lucky enough to return to Cape Town we wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.
811611,36770689,2015-07-01,369209,Kirsty,Ursula's home is in a beautiful neighborhood. We woke each morning early given our jetlagged Australian state and enjoyed wandering despite the winter rain because the houses are just so pretty. And we fell in love with the family at the closeby Blue Cafe where we could coffee early and in the evening  devour their yummy soups and deserts.  Ursula is wonderfully efficient -- leaving extensive and helpful descriptions of the neighborhood and Cape Town itself. And she was a great help as we got oriented in an unfamiliar Town.  The self-contained room was extremely comfortable despite the winter cold  the ultimate test Ursula has equipped the kitchen and bathroom with all that you'd require on a short or long stay - even an SA electric transformer. And most importantly  a comfy bed. We strolled down the hill and within ten minutes you'll find dozens of options for shoppingfood etc. Living like the locals as opposed to a tourist hub. The internet wifi system was tempermanental but we were on a work trip so were undoubtedly more sensitive to its nuances than the average traveller.
811611,38102120,2015-07-13,29138215,Mike,8 on Burnside was everything that we were hoping for. Ursula was an extremely helpful host with useful advice as well as arranging for our rental car at a very good price and transport from the airport. The accommodation was clean and spacious and met all of our needs. It was a comfortable  attractive space. There were very nice cafes and restaurants within walking distance. These were popular with the locals and this helped us get the Cape Town experience. The location is very handy to Table Mountain and close to Lion Head from which we watched a beautiful sunset. We walked into town a couple of times but it was usually a quick and easy taxi ride. The security at the accommodation was very good and we felt safe at all times. We were there in the middle of winter and I imagine that the venue would be even better when the weather was warmer.
811611,39686138,2015-07-25,21583172,Fieke,Het was een erg leuke tijd in Kaapstad. Ursula is een hele vrolijke en fijne gastvrouw  met goede tips. Het appartement is erg goed.
811611,40473977,2015-07-31,22949209,Julia,What a great place - a pleasant  perfectly comfortable room with high ceilings  with adjoining bath and kitchenette - more than enough for a home base for our couple of days in Cape Town. Would definitely plan on a repeat visit Ursula was an exceptional hostess and had thought of many small touches a book of maps and restaurant info  an international charger  tea and avocados stocked in the kitchen that made our stay even easier. She also was available by text for any questions we had  which we appreciated. The neighborhood is lovely  a quiet residential one of Victorian-type houses felt like San Francisco to me with a super small neighborhood cafe around the corner  and access to more restaurants and shops literally two blocks down the hill loved the neighborhoody fish place. Definitely close enough to the parts of the city farther downtown - rather than a touristy fizz  this felt like a wisely residential area where real people live. Parking on the street right in front of the house was no problem. Did I mention being nestled up under views of Table Mountain Overall a perfect oasis for our stay.
811611,42266517,2015-08-12,6508673,Stephanie,I would give Ursula 6 stars if I could. She arranged airport transfer for us  plus a taxi to Table Mountain  and gave us a ton of advice on things to do and how to do them. The room was clean  spacious  convenient to fun activities and comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here
811611,43973454,2015-08-23,39067618,Benjamin,Ursula was a great host who looked after us and booked us a couple of taxis. She was very informative and I feel lucky to have had such an excellent airbnb host
811611,44772596,2015-08-29,34419834,Edward,Ursula was very welcoming  upbeat  knowledgeable and delightful--she greeted us as we arrived in the transportation she arranged from the airport. She provided an orientation to our space-- the main room  kitchen  bathroom and private courtyard.   She inquired about our plan and made some suggestions on how we might visit and make best use of our time in Cape Town and beyond.  She provides an exellent guidebook with local restaurants  tours  and activities... She is also a licensed tour guide and arrangedserved as our private guide to Cape of Good Hope-- one of the highlights of our visit.  Better than any tourbook-- Ursula provides the inside scoop on all things to do in the city and the many nearby places of interest and things to do including a trek up Table Mountain-- a breath-taking site that can be seen from your courtyard
811611,45461513,2015-09-03,7671621,Leo Anthony,Excellent location  great accommodation  fantastic host. What more can you ask for
811611,46582649,2015-09-12,18302188,Sonya,Ursula has a beauiful place in an amazing location and her and her friend Alet were wonderful hosts. Everything about the booking process   etc was very efficient. We really felt like we had out own place as everything was seperate. Great view of table mountain from the patio and very close to the centre. Felt very safe staying here would recommend to anyone.
811611,47611661,2015-09-21,11711759,Janet,Ursula made us feel super welcome and we were so happy to see that her airbnb was was accurately described and even better than expected. The location is perfect handy to everything  in a beautiful area and there are some very good eating places and bars nearby. Ursula was away for most of our stay but her assistant apologies have forgotten her name is super helpful eg organising a car hire for us late in the day and finding a place to get something fixed. I can thoroughtly recommend this airbnb.
811611,49229025,2015-10-02,13658864,Elke,Nice room and perfect location. And Ursula was a great host. Highly recommended.
811611,50748770,2015-10-14,10306479,Caterina,Ursula was a phenomenal host - very helpful  available and knowledgeable. The flat is lovely  comfortable  spotless and well appointed. Great location with access to whatever you might be interested in. Would stay here again for sure.
811611,52313528,2015-10-28,5600104,Renske,Ursula's place is located near a lot of nice restaurants in a great area. The apartment is nice with a private patio where you can have your own breakfast in the sun if you like. Ursula was helpful and easy to contact.
811611,53467079,2015-11-09,43789785,Anne,8 on Burnside is a fantastic spot from which to explore Cape Town. Tamboerskloof is an exciting  vibrant neighborhood  and lots of shops and wonderful restaurants and cafes are only a short walk away. Try Chalk and Board on nearby Kloof Street for fabulous tapas. In addition  Ursula and her friend Alet  who greeted us when we arrived make you feel welcome and at home in the lovely flat.
811611,54486298,2015-11-20,40249495,Gcobani,I enjoyed my stay at this place  Ursula was very helpful and was a great host. I will stay in this place again when in CTN
811611,54841185,2015-11-25,573690,Karen,It was a pleasure being at Ursulas Place. Beauiful decorated  clean  neat and very welcoming. The location is perfect to stroll around and to enjoy Gardens. Great Restaurants and Breakfast Places around the corner. We came with a babygirl and it was a perfect hideaway in the Center of the city Hope to come back
811611,55339507,2015-12-01,20048814,Nadine,Sleeping at Ursula's apartment is probably one of the best opportunities for visitiors of the mother city at all. Not only that the apartment itself is wonderfully equipped and of well styled arrangement or the location is just perfect with only few streets distance to both city and mountain but still quiet and lovely surrounded by frequented cafes and restaurants. It is also about Ursula  who is probably the best host at all as she is professional in leading tourists thruogh the cape region and garden route and there is in fact no idea of things that could occassionally be useful for her guests that she has omitted. Just the perfect stay  here is my recommendation If Ursula's Apartment is available  better book quickly and don't reconsider
811611,55654598,2015-12-04,2064466,Sara,Lovely outdoor seating area enclosed and great location in walking distance to all the fun in Cape Town Central
811611,59627175,2016-01-13,11276499,Elizabeth,From the minute I booked this place  Ursula was helpful.  We communicated a few times before hand for suggestions on a car rental and airport transport to her place.  Upon arrival  she gave us the lay of the land inside her picturesque courtyard accommodation as well as pointing us in the right directions for food  groceries  tips on best ways to see sights  etc. etc.  The apt. was quiet  had fun decor  and kitchen more than adequate.  Great location easy access to everything. We appreciated her energy  generosity and direct personality and humor.  Rent this place if you come to Cape Town
811611,59993012,2016-01-18,8114350,Claudia,Ursula hat uns nett empfangen  uns die Rumlichkeiten erklrt und direkt ein paar Tipps gegeben  wo man abends essen gehen kann. Von den Nachbarn bekommt man gar nichts mit und von Ursula eigentlich auch nicht. Eine kleine Oase inmitten der Stadt. Vieles liegt in Laufabstand und eine kleine Ecke  die Richtige  vom Table Mountain kann man vom privaten Innenhof sehen.
811611,60452208,2016-01-24,2859023,Mara,The place is just as it looks on the pictures  lovely  clean and with the nice courtyard. I had a great week here. Tamboerskloof in an area up the hill of the city centre quiet and with lovely views on the mountain. If you walk down hill it is a hilly area  good exercise you have all the nice bars and restaurants. It was really warm when I was there  so the planned airco that Ursula told about sounded like a good plan. Would recommend this place and definitely stay again.
811611,60946059,2016-01-30,238272,Samuel,Perfect stay great location  spacious room  nice outdoor area  clean etc. Host was very accommodating and went out of her way to help us - thank you Only wish we could have stayed longer...hope to be back soon.
811611,61369583,2016-02-03,5401570,Willemijn,We had a wonderful stay here The apartment is charming  very well equipped and on a perfect location. Ursula was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. She gave us some nice suggestions for activities and restaurants and replied to our messages almost immediately. In short  we would love to come back again in the future
811611,62689634,2016-02-16,33091174,Robyn,We had such a lovely time staying with Ursula  she was a fantastic host and we would highly recommend staying at her place She was full of helpful hints and tips on places to go. The apartment was lovely  especially the courtyard. We had all the amenities we needed  it was nice and quiet and in quick walking distance to restaurants and shops. Parking was easy too.
471729,598452460,2020-01-27,13134862,Tom,We spent 5 nights in Gregorys lovely soulful cottage. Its the sort of place wed happily live in. It just feels right. You will enjoy a spacious kitchenliving room  large veranda with beautiful views of the nature reserve we saw ostriches and buck and a distant view of the sea. Theres also a great sheltered braai area which we used a few times. The kitchen is very well equipped  with the most fabulous view from the sink that any washer-upper could wish for The WiFi works well enough but this is a place to chill and relax  far from the stress of the global rat race. Walking 5-10 minutes down to the beach was easy and safe  and such a pleasure. Gregorys family were incredibly welcoming and friendly  always ready to answer questions or help out changing gas bottles and the like. Wed love to stay there again when visiting.
471729,604409335,2020-02-11,56735764,Paul,Wonderful place. Nicely located in a quiet part of town  with a great view of the reserve.
471729,606203696,2020-02-16,334969371,Fergus,A wonderful seaside getaway space  perfect for resting  rejuvenating and writing or meditative time out from the city.
471729,612711417,2020-03-01,60801024,Stanley,This is a charming and slightly quirky cottage with great amenities and everything works. Great kitchen  terrific shower  ample space for two people. A lovely little porch on which to have sundowners or breakfast. A good enough position  a short 5 minute walk to the beach. A flawless experience.
471729,714044699,2020-12-07,56565358,Billie-Mae,Wonderful cottage near the seaside . Friendly hosts and great location .

The cottage is very secure and well situated in a natural area on the edge of the reserve with a partial ocean view.. perfect to check in on the wind and waves from the deck The cottage is super cozy  well-equipped with all of the utensils and linens that we needed  and the braai space was perfect. The wifi was actually really fast and reliable so we were able to get a bit of work done while we were there. We had an awesome stay and will definitely be back again

471729,745322301,2021-04-04,71432841,Daleen,SUCH A BRILLIANT STAY  Even better than the pictures  Gregory and his wife could not have been more helpful and hospitable.  The cottage was central  clean  easy and a wonderful stay.  I can recommend their place to anyone looking for a peaceful  comfortable breakaway.  A real gem.  Wonderful x
471729,749721596,2021-04-18,2205348,Lyndall,A great little cottage  loved the location  had everything we needed and loved the little slide for the kids  and we slept like a dream.
471729,596849612489534367,2022-04-03,60248259,Jason,Gregorys place was a perfect quiet getaway to get some reading and writing done. Would be happy to come back for another staycation

471729,1130367915530552805,2024-04-08,58872236,Teresa,it was an amazing hide away for my last weekend in SA to gather thoughts in nature
473856,1696770,2012-07-13,2415625,Kristen,This apartment is beautiful  even nicer than the photos  and the location in Cape Town is perfectly central and accessible. Right across the street from Company's Gardens and adjacent to Long Street Loved it.
473856,1957514,2012-08-12,2881389,Ragnhild Vreim,It is a great place  right in town
811611,63610712,2016-02-25,3352971,Ellie,Ursula's cosy apartment set in a lovely leafy neighbourhood made a great base for our time in Cape Town. The location is perfect  really close to Table Mountain for hiking  there are plenty of neighbourhood cafes and bars close by  and the city centre is within walking distance. Ursula made us feel really welcome. She's a convivial host  full of information to help you make the most of your stay in the city and is always on hand to help out with any queries.
811611,63895939,2016-02-28,35835248,Kornkanok,Ursula is very responsive  unfortunately we didn't get to meet her. But her friend  Alet  welcomed and provided us with useful informations. The apartment is cozy located in great location to explore the city. Highly recommended.
811611,66466575,2016-03-22,18050903,Alison,We spent 5 nights in Ursula's lovely apartment in Cape Town and had a fantastic experience. The apartment is located in an area you would love to live in if Cape Town was home. It is in a safe  quite affluent part of the city and there are various local cafes  bars and restaurants very nearby. We walked everywhere. Kloof street has lots of amenities and nice spots to hang out  and we also walked to Long street and Bree Street to sample different nightlife. The apartment is comfortable and spacious and well supplied. Ursula was a kind  helpful host and we would highly recommend staying here.
811611,68296851,2016-04-04,1789390,Erika,Thank you Ursula for making my stay so welcome in Cape Town.

I did not meet Katrin until I left Cape Town  but she was most welcoming and helpful via email. Retrieving the key when I arriving was straightforward.

The apartment is wonderfully situated and we enjoyed exploring nearby Kloof Street and the park. The only problem we had is that the windows have to be closed at night to block out the noise from nearby pubs  and it was very hot while we were staying  but once we worked out how to run the air conditioning through from the lounge  everything was fine and we slept well. The pool belonging to the apartment block is also lovely.

The neighborhood is lively  safe  and not deserted at night. Also it is super scenic with the mountains right behind. Don't miss the nice restaurants on Roodebloem Street  walking distance from the house. Angela and Feisal are wonderful  engaging and super helpful hosts.
812750,30415862,2015-04-21,1408860,Elisabeth,Angela and her husband are very kind persons and they have a wonderful house in Cape Town. They rent out rooms with a nice view and if you want more privacy you can rent their side house. A great place to stay for a fair price.
473856,54583780,2015-11-22,5696106,Evalyn,Katrine's apartment is perfectly located to explore the historical sights of Cape Town on foot.  Being across from the company gardens was a big plus as well. The apartment was comfortable  modern  nicely appointed and clean. We appreciated the welcoming touches she provided chocolates and flowers as well as her time to answer our questions about the area and logistics. Secure parking and the security of the building was comforting and we felt quite safe.  If you want to be in the city center  close to Long Street  but not in the thick of the action  this is the place to be. It is also close to a number of car rental companies  gas stations  an places to buy food. All in all  very convenient  pleasant and a great location. We would definitely return if we visit again

812750,67983648,2016-04-01,49935267,John,We felt very welcome in Angela's home. They are one block away from the MyCiti 102 bus stop so it was easy to get to. The last bus back was around 830pm so you'll have to take a taxi if you stay out late. Our room was great  the bed was comfy and we had large windows and a door to the balcony.

The close proximity to the lovely Gardens and central Cape Town were an easy walk away. Good restaurants were close by in Dunkley Square  Long Street and Bree Street. The allocated parking bay was an added bonus in the city Centre. Katrin was a great host and communicated regularly to meet us for check in. Check out was easy. We would highly recommend her apartment for any other guests to Cape Town.
473856,92483267,2016-08-08,26088927,John,Wonderful central located apartment.   Really enjoyed our stay and Katrin was an excellent host.  Hand over was great and Katrin ran through everything.  Would highly recommend staying here.

473856,103330337,2016-09-21,28276727,Jeffrey,Perfect place to stay when in Cape Town. Very central to lots of great resturants and things to do. Lambert and Katrin were fantastic hosts. I arrived late in the evening from my flight and their local driver waited an hour and a half for me. It was nice to have someone local take me into town. Upon my arrival at St. Martini Gardens  Lambert greeted me and showed me around. He was so friendly and the bottle of wine he welcomed me with was delilcious. The grounds were imaculate  very well kept litte oaisis in the city. The pool looked very nice  weather was to cold for a swim. Wonderful  friendly  caring hosts. Any time I had a question they were more than happy to answer. I will absolutely stay with Katrin again when I visit this amazing city.
473856,115616239,2016-11-26,25579009,Mariko,Die Kommunikation mit Katrin hat wunderbar funktioniert und auch beim Check In hat alles perfekt geklappt. Die Wohnung war gerumig und fr zwei Personen mit viel Gepck ideal geeignet. Die Lage war sehr zentral  nur wenige Minuten zu Fu bis zur Long Street  wo sich viele Restaurants und Bars befinden.

473856,138514900,2017-03-20,1035832,Fernanda,Katrin's place is great  and just as described in the pictures. The double glaze windows are essential at night  as the apartment is near the street with most of the night life. Once closed  the nightclubs buzz is completely silenced. The closets had lots of space for our clothes  the bathroom was great  the air con  washing machine and dishwasher were super useful for us. The is no air con in the bedroom  but  as we are really used to sleeping with it on warm nights  we just left the living room and bedroom doors opened connecting the 2 areas and it worked out fine. It's walking distance to great restaurants  super market  shops  pharmacy  etc. One of the sightseeing bus lines goes by right in front of the building  which  by the way  is super safe. And the Company Garden is a lovely place for a morning walk or breakfast. We definitely recommend staying there.
473856,139199991,2017-03-24,11580214,Steve,Great place  good location  very comfortable

473856,149067172,2017-05-02,2027685,Adolfo,The apartment is as described. Definitely feels bigger than I expected from looking at the pictures. Central to Cape Town's nightlife scene  restaurants and caf's. The parking and elevator access is convenient. The apartment building access is controlled with 24-7 security guards. Katrin was a great host and very responsive.
473856,159947003,2017-06-12,22024652,Peg,The place is exactly as as beautiful as pictured.  No surprises.  The location can't be beat and it was such a bonus to be across the street from Company's Garden.  Another plus is that Katrina recommended someone who could meet us at the airport and bring us directly to the place.  That worked out perfectly.  I would stay here again if the opportunity ever arose.
473856,176926942,2017-08-01,582678,Charite,Stayed at Katrin's place to attend an early morning function at Mount Nelson  it was so convenient The apartment was beautifully decorated loved the fresh proteas  it was very clean and well equipped. I will recommend this apartment.
473856,187666425,2017-08-27,47120067,Thyag,The apartment was as described in the pictures.  Very clean  comfortable and spacious.  Much better than staying in a hotel  Building was safe and secure with a underground parking space.  Katrin was great with communication and even checked in periodically to ensure we were comfortable.  The apartment is minutes away from table mountain  VA waterfront and other scenic attractions  bars and restaurants.  We will be back when visiting Cape Town.  Thanks Katrin
473856,194509326,2017-09-17,4238733,Riley,This place is 5 stars. Katrin is among the best hosts I've encountered  and has obvious professional training in hospitality. The place is what I would call posh and is located in the most central part of Cape Town for both daytime activities museums  gardens  etc. and nightlife. With so much to do in the area you'll wish you had more time to spend in this great apartment.
473856,204269151,2017-10-17,27097853,Joanna,Katrin is an excellent hostess. The apartment is excellent.

473856,218339103,2017-12-12,9248823,Francois,Great stay at Katrin's place. Perfect location across from the pretty Company's Gardens  and just a short walk away from the trendy places on Kloof Street. Having a swimming pool in the building is a plus during the summer period. Katrin's was very reactive. I would really recommend this place
473856,220869419,2017-12-24,159899668,Shahul,Being a good host takes quite a bit of planning and energy and Katrin is an outstanding host. She will help you settle in and will grant you the space you need to enjoy your holiday. The location is great if you plan your stay in Cape Town diligently. Respect and trust is what she gave and in return  and one should give the same to you and great unit at St Martini Garden.

473856,242069789,2018-03-11,1027755,Eric,Katrin came to my rescue after my other Airbnb reservation was cancelled with only a few hours notice. Katrin was highly responsive and was able to check me in with only 30 minutes notice. She is in the hospitality industry  so she get's it. The location is wonderful in a very secure building. The shower water got hot very quickly  which is nice in these times of drought. The bed is very comfortable.

473856,273160088,2018-06-05,2595113,Khadija,Great space to live while in Cape Town - clean  beautiful and safe.
473856,286974197,2018-07-07,22369717,Tiffany And Brian,Katrins apartment was perfect for our stay in Cape Town.  It is situated in a perfect location  walking distance to restaurants and shops on Long Street  museums  galleries  and more.  The apartment was very clean and comfortable  with a full kitchen with everything you need.  The balcony was a nice place to enjoy a glass of wine at the end of the day or coffee in the morning.  Katrin was also a stellar host.  She set us up with driver to pick us up from the airport  which was really nice because we didnt have a SA SIM card in our phones yet to Uber.  It was so nice to arrive in the airport after 25 hours of traveling and see Gary waiting for us right outside customs  who drove us to and checked us into the apartment.  Gary was super nice and is available to hire during your stay as well.  The apartment was very secure and had a parking bay for our rental car.  Overall a great stay
473856,305406025,2018-08-11,152271625,Loraine,Expect your stay to be comfortable in this bright  sunny apartment. Your super host is exactly that - professional  efficient and quick to respond. Sound proof windows are wonderful if youre a particularly light sleeper. Curtains and blinds promise late mornings if you require. Kitchen is very well equipped with good appliances. The only thing we would say in caution is that parking our long wheelbase 4x4 was manageable but tight. All round  a good stay.
473856,305966706,2018-08-12,123705052,Inneke,Great stay Clean  secure and lovely location.

473856,415277522,2019-02-22,14669913,Harriet,Katrin was very communicative and a lovely host. The apartment is in a fantastic location  close to the action of Kloof  Bree and also the beautiful gardens opposite with a great little cafe  too. We were slightly warm at night as the air con in the living area doesnt reach the bedroom  and having the window open meant the nightclub behind the block was slightly unfortunate. However  it was great value overall and I would recommend it.
473856,416073021,2019-02-24,25609471,Alex,A great place in heart location  close to long street. Katrin is super friendly.

473856,445890000,2019-04-30,197066556,Ashlen,Katrin and her husband were great hosts The apartment is in a very safe beautiful area close to restaurants  bars and grocery stores and is a quick Uber ride to V  A waterfront and Table Mountain
473856,449168727,2019-05-06,51855826,Laura,Wonderful space and an ideal location to explore Cape Town.
473856,508126116,2019-08-12,3934891,Jeremy,Great place to stay. Clean. Lovely host. Just perfect
473856,518756962,2019-08-27,5352925,Jesse,Very nice accommodations. Great location close to Company Gardens.
473856,570709541,2019-11-30,50018838,Cale,Katrin was an excellent host and our apartment was lovely. We stayed for two weeks and Katrin was very responsive with our needs and helpful in providing recommendations for staying and navigating Cape Town. The apartment is in a prime location and it was really easy to travel via Uber to any part of the city. The apartment is definitely near the center of a lot of activity  so there was a bit of noise if the windows were open at night  but my wife and I had no trouble sleeping  especially in the comfy bed. The apartment was lovely and had everything we needed for our stay.
473856,576060550,2019-12-12,238130945,Lais,O apartamento  funcional  agradvel e bem localizado  bem em frente aos jardins da Companhia  de onde se pode ver claramente a Table Mountain.  prximo ao centro da cidade e linhas do nibus de turismo Red Bus passam perto. Duas ruas acima o local  um pouco mau frequentadas e h agitao at a madrugada   mas o apartamento tem vidros  prova de som. Katrin foi muito gentil e prestativa  providenciou tudo o q precisvamos. Faltou energia eltrica com alguma frequncia   ento  aconselhvel comprar um chip telefnico para no ficar dependente do wi-fi para solicitar uber ou txi   por exemplo.
473856,590317859,2020-01-08,10434113,Nick,We stayed for 3 weeks with a 10 week old baby  and loved our time there. The location is perfect  and gave us many options for brunch  short walks  museums  and other things to do. The bed was comfortable  the kitchen well-equipped and quite large  and the bathroom had a big shower. The safe and quiet garden and swimming pool were awesome. In terms of service  we really appreciated that Katrin went the extra mile she installed a smart tv box so we could watch Netflix  and when we forgot a coat doh she arranged for it to be sent to Europe. Thx
473856,596900075,2020-01-24,203238023,Hilary,We really enjoyed staying at Katrins apartment  it's in our favourite part of Cape town. It was very spacious and comfortable. Close to the shops and restaurants. Would definitely stay there again.  Access to the apartment was quick and easy.

473856,705682421,2020-11-01,335803082,Producer,I rented Katrin's apartment for a guest director from 'up country'  in town to rehearse and direct the first on stage opera production for a live audience since March   It was really important for us that he should feel at home  safe and secure during which was bound to be a challenging experience - working from behind a mask and with a bottle of sanitizer in his pocket. Our guest was thrilled from day 1 - with the location  space  furnishings and amenities and found Katrin a most welcoming host. Thank you for a wonderful experience we hope to be back again soon.
473856,717069934,2020-12-21,4169751,Sarah,Katrin's place was a great choice for my stay in Cape Town. The flat is comfortable  private  and has a washing machine. There was a bottle of wine waiting for me when I arrived  which was very welcome after long days of travel. St. Martini Gardens is a clean and secure apartment complex located within walking distance of so many great spots in Cape Town. The pool and parking are nice too
473856,719974530,2020-12-31,221345853,Redaa,Such a lovely and comfy space Katrin is an awesome and welcoming host as well. Ill highly recommend her place
473856,722298000,2021-01-06,238761057,Aaron,The apartment is in a perfect location to access great Cape Town dining  bars and shops. It is also close to the PathCare Mediclinic for easy Covid testing. The Company Gardens green space is also right across the street which makes for a nice stroll in the morningevening. The kitchen was spacious and well supplied with cooking equipment. Katrin recommended a trusted driver  Gary  who lives in the building. He's a wonderful driver  very punctual and knows the city like the back of his hand. He took us around several times and to the airport as well. This was a big plus.
473856,761348183911336333,2022-11-16,20458174,Anna,Excellent apartment - very comfortable and clean  perfect location. Would love to come back anytime.

473856,1010062853319929562,2023-10-25,9555485,Ian,Katrin's apartment is freshly renovated and everything is in perfect condition. It is comfortable and well equipped  with a battery and inverter to get you through load shedding. Building has good security and is very central - in easy walking distance of shops  restaurants and night life  and across the street from the gardens. It's in the city  so on weekends you'll hear music and noise  but the bedroom windows are double glazed which cuts most of it out. Had a great stay.
473856,1030243251195182521,2023-11-22,538001298,Jnos,Fantastische Wohnung in zentraler Lage. Werde ich definitiv weiterempfehlen. Unkompliziert und stressfrei gebucht und eingecheckt. Danke Katrin
473856,1033890895166645590,2023-11-27,543600357,Adeeb,Simply  it was a fantastic apartment

473856,1049927181044205696,2023-12-19,60655563,Daphne,Wij hebben genoten van de prachtige woning van Katrin. Het was echt een super plek  met een prachtig park voor ons. Winkels en restaurants op loopafstand. Verder alles goed te bereiken met een Uber en of taxi. Echt een aanrader deze plek. Onze zoon van 1 5 heeft het er enorm naar zijn zin gehad  wij daarmee nog meer
473856,1057887842432868294,2023-12-30,56548139,Gabryone,Katrin s place was a delight to stay in .  She communicated every step of the way. Situated in Capetown City Centre and not too far from Seapoint and Camps Bay . No car is needed since a taxi and Uber is accessible . Restaurants and other places are nearby .
473856,1076725734084339354,2024-01-25,6743413,Joelle,I had an exceptional stay at Katrinas Airbnb The space was pristine and even better than the photos. The place was centrally located in town with easy access to several restaurants and activities in the city center. As a solo traveler  I felt safe in the area and appreciated the added security on the property.  Katrin was incredibly hospitable and responsive. I will most certainly be retiring for my next visit
473856,1094108483989651446,2024-02-18,497283628,Tom,We highly enjoyed the apartment. The area was perfect  in the centre of the city  with lots of activities  nearby. Minor issue was some noise  as a consequence of louder music in the neighbourhood  on Friday and Saturday night. Load shedding was sufficiently compensated by a back-up power system. Also the swimming was a benefit  given the sunny and warm weather. Conclusion we had a perfect stay  apartment can be recommended
473856,1121672475303028196,2024-03-27,221915335,Heather,Katrin is a wonderful and very responsive host - she went above and beyond. Having a weekly cleaner is a definite bonus. The location  in St Martini Gardens is beautifully maintained and was a great addition to - I went almost daily to play in the park or pool with my son. Though you have to be careful in the Company Gardens and nearby the apartment is secure and I never felt unsafe there.  I would definitely stay at Katrins apartment again
473856,1128091053040478644,2024-04-05,145836794,Kelly,Pristine apartment with great design. Loved the location across the street from the Companys Garden  and the quick walk to the great stores and coffee shops of Kloof Street.
473856,1133202917094812948,2024-04-12,252172361,Fiona,Katrins apartment is absolutely perfect  it has everything you need. Close to many restaurants and opposite Company Gardens for walks. She has decorated as if she lives there herself  making it feel very special. The sun pours in  in the mornings. Really comfortable bed for a good peaceful sleep. Katrin was very flexible with my arrival time and met me at the apartment and explained everything  and even left me a letter with all the information if I had a memory lapse Thank you for an outstanding stay.

474596,829528596029930673,2023-02-18,282136808,Sarah,This is a wonderful family home with spacious  clean and luxurious accommodation.  All bedrooms are en suite and a good size.  The upstairs bedroom was very hot but had air conditioning to keep it cool.  The gardens and pool really made it for us.  It was such a wonderful private space and the pool was a great size.  Victor  the housekeeper  was around most days but was discreet and accommodating and there are two cats that live at the house.  It felt very safe and was in a lovely location  within a short drive of lots of shopping and restaurants.  The host was very helpful before and during our trip  answering questions promptly.  We would love to stay here again when we visit Cape Town

487252,79229661,2016-06-12,18184611,Marianna,The photos don't actually do the place justice - it's such a roomy  full of light  lovely apartment - feels more like an one bedroom than a studio. Clean  modern  stylish decor - especially liked both the kitchen and bathroom. Cold in the winter but the hosts were thoughtful enough to leave a heater. Phenomenal location - five minutes walk from Main Road with loads of cafes  restaurants  and shops.

O prdio  um pouco antigo  com 2 lances de escada e sem porteiro  mas isso no foi problema. O check in e check out acontecem em uma pousada prxima  de fcil acesso de carro e os anfitries foram super acessveis  via e-mail e WhatsApp. Alm disso  tambm deixaram frutas  leite e limparam o apartamento na metade da nossa estadia. O local tem aquecedor  ferro e secador de cabelo  que foram super teis para ns no inverno. O banheiro molha um pouco  mas  moderno e com chuveiro com gua quente e ducha forte. O custo beneficio tambm foi timo Adoramos

487261,493227723909154529,2021-11-11,23695354,Klara,A delightful studio apartment for an individual or couple. The place has a lot of light and sunshine streaming in with a far-off view of Table Mountain and a closer garden haven directly outside. I stayed here to do work and it was a perfect space to reflect and write. Would definitely stay here again
842387,24307918,2014-12-25,10366619,Tiffany,Adam was helpful  informative.  Picking us up at the airport for a small fee  Met some nice people also staying at the house Close to Long St.  Busing distance or cab ride to harbour
842387,24587693,2014-12-31,9781512,Amy,Adam is an extremely friendly host and was really kind to pick us up from our previous accommodation to his place. His place is conveniently located near Kloof St where you can find many restaurants and also just 3mins walk to myciti bus stop.  Table Mountain is in close proximity as well. We have an en-suite room with attached bathroom. It's a good place if you are just looking for a basic accommodation to rest. Soundproofing in the house could be improved.
842387,25902906,2015-01-29,861414,Benjamin,Adam is welcoming and easy going host. Nice apartment perfectly located.
842387,27051573,2015-02-24,19060907,Christine,Adam was an excellent host Very hospitable and helpful when needed. Gave us a good tour of his place and settled us in quite nicely. Very welcoming and place was according to what was advertised. Great place to stay  would definitely come back

842387,27529222,2015-03-07,24350560,Maximilian,Wir wurden sehr nett empfangen und herumgefhrt. Die Lage der Unterkunft in Tamberskloef ist wirklich perfekt. Keine 5 min Fuweg trennen einen von Shoppen  Essen und Supermrkten. Trotzdem ist das Haus sehr ruhig gelegen  was wirklich entspannend war. Wir haben den Aufenthalt bei Adam genossen
842387,28712035,2015-03-29,5429503,Swie Hong,Adam was a great host. Perfect place and excellent location. Very safe neighbourhood and at a freat spot near Kloof Street.
842387,53297932,2015-11-07,30651992,Stefan,Lovely and safe stay. Adam was a great host  thanks
511414,2931017,2012-11-20,4043479,Christine,Nice place to stay close to all you want to do and Jaco was very helpful in getting things sorted out for us.  I would stay here again.  Internet was not available in the apartment but free Wifi was available downstairs in the lobby so it was not a problem.
511414,3610405,2013-02-26,3630242,Donna,BRING YOUR OWN TOILET PAPER  We originally were suppose to be in Rockwell hotel but were changed to 905 dockside.  Was told was upgrade but believe is not.  Swimming pool is joke  No coffee maker  no laundry in suite or building even though said was in building  No front lobby  security doesn't have phone so can't call taxi for you or anything  View was great but don't be out after dark or wear jewelry - have been muggings just outside building. Lots of things to see around area and is beautiful but this is not luxury place.  No air conditioning in bedroom and got very hot. You get one roll of toilet paper when arrive and one at midweek clean and that is it  If paying for meet and greet insist that the person is experienced. Ours couldn't answer any of our questions.  The transfer to airport was great but little expensive.  Overall was ok but not sure would stay at dockside again.  Firemans bar at corner is great
511414,713648147,2020-12-06,367089027,Lavona,Definitely a home away from home. Convenient stay near to all shops and beach
516875,2867644,2012-11-12,1497835,Bjrn Halvor,I and a friend stayed in this apartment for a week  and both the apartment and the host really delivered The apartment lies in a very nice part of the city  with walking distance to many attractions  including Long Street  Waterfront etc. It has a nice balcony with great view  and indoor its spacious and tidy. More or less all you need for a great stay in a great city. The Rockwell building is also very convenient with an exercise room and a nice restaurant in ground floor. The original plan was to stay there for six nights  but we liked the apartment and the city a lot  so we extended out stay with one more night. The host  Willem  was very cooperative and did his best to make our stay as good as possible.
516875,2956685,2012-11-25,3215019,Adam,Great spot Nice apartment and the hosts did everything in their power to make our stay enjoyable
516875,3135448,2012-12-22,2524500,Gavin,I booked this apartment because of the ideal location close to great bars and restaurants  yet sea facing so no noise Perfect. Opening up the balcony at night was really special and we actually ended up spending more time enjoying the view and lights and spent more time in the apartment than expected. Hope its available next time
516875,3356256,2013-01-16,3598462,Reto,It's a great place to stay in Cape Town. Everything was OK and we had a good time.
516875,3414261,2013-01-26,287667,Carrie,A lovely apartment.  Danielle  who takes care of it was OTT helping us  TV question  etc.  Lovely view  nice to have 2 bathrooms.  Well appointed kitchen.
516875,3610621,2013-02-26,2766950,Steve,Great apartment in exactly the right area of the city to get to the CTICC and still be close to fun things to do.  Very nice building with all the amenities of a nice hotel too.
516875,3862328,2013-03-22,4710914,Jodi,The hosts were highly responsive and provided great information. The apartment is clean  super well-situated  and has lovely views of the waterfront.
516875,3891981,2013-03-25,5226705,Danielle,The location of the apartment is nice and central. A great starting point to explore Cape Town. To be honest I had expected more of the apartment itself. We stayed here with four ladies and the beds were actually too small to sleep in it for 2 people. The apartment was also a bit stuffy and dusty.
516875,4105265,2013-04-10,382485,Roberto,Great apartment with a lot of advantages. We really enjoyed having a parking lot underneath the building. You can literally reach your car with the elavator from your doorstep. Also  the flat is very large. It was nice to have 2 bathrooms and a lot of room to stow clothes etc. The best thing of course is the huge terrace. When you open the windows  it feels like your living room is a giant balcony with harbour views - esp. breathtaking at night. Communication was fast and easy. But like so often with airbnb flats  there were some issues with the wifi. First  the code was not working - then  even with a functioning code  it was very slow and actually only worked in the sleeping rooms. So if internet is important for you  you should consider this. Also  as indicated in the description  costs for electricity are on top which I found quite unusual  but for 5 days it was just about 3 Euros. However  if you use the aircon  it might be much higher. All in all  I can still suggest staying here. It's right in the middle of waterkant village with a lot of great eateries. Don't miss burger dinner at Beefcakes with the probably hottest waiters in town Also great Sunday half price sushi in the super-stylish Beluga which is nearby. And also don't miss bfast with the hipsters at Loading Bay at Loader Street. If you like good food  Waterkant Village is the place to be
516875,4475581,2013-05-07,4889350,Benoit,The appartment is very nice  good situation  great view.
516875,8629876,2013-11-09,1363271,Michael,This is a modern  smallish but very comfortable two-bedroom apartment overlooking the harbour and the bay. Its location is superb in a quiet street just off a stylish shopping area  close to the centre of town  and with lots of cafes and restaurants just around the corner. It has great views from the balcony and even from the lounge through the floor-to-ceiling windows. It is located in an apartment hotel and the receptionists and concierge are very helpful. There were some small maintenance issues that Willem made sure were solved very quickly. Highly recommended
516875,10765796,2014-03-06,11836574,Rolf,Best Location - everything was clean and proper. Stayed for three nights. Anything you need in walking distance
516875,22186067,2014-11-01,20935126,Thomas,Willem  the owner  has hired a rental agent so that everything was taking care of.
516875,23240889,2014-11-26,22323863,Simon,The apartment is really lovely and well located in the De Waterkant area of Cape Town.  The apartment is in a hotel building.  Keys can be collected from the hotel reception making check-in very easy and guests have access to the hotel's gym and pool.  The host was helpful and response to email queries.
516875,23547593,2014-12-04,5014910,James,Amazing  clean apartment in a secure building. Great location. Short walk to CCICC. Highly recommended.
516875,26650575,2015-02-16,9256895,Trong,Booking was easy with Willem. The apartment was comfortable and modern  spacious enough for 2-3 people. We had a bit of a problem with getting the garage remote but it was resolved quickly. We did find one of the rooms was slept in and the bed not made when we arrived  but luckily the apartment had a washer and dryer so we were able to clean the sheets ourselves. The location of the place is perfect and secure. The fast internet connection was much appreciated.
842387,56230732,2015-12-10,29571350,Catrin,Freundlicher   auf Anhieb sympatischer Gastgeber.  Alles easy mit ihm abzuklren. Nette WG artige Wohnung in top Lage mit schnem Hinterhof.
842387,56721340,2015-12-17,27477661,Joerg,Pnklicher  freundlicher und aufmerksamer Empfang Die Lage in Kapstadt war perfekt fr den abendlichen Ausgang zum Essen und Trinken.
842387,57092332,2015-12-21,4977589,Sarah,Great location and house Adam was very accommodating and helpful Will definitely return ans recommend this place
842387,57805999,2015-12-29,50204112,Matthias,Adam was super friendly and helpful in any way. Nothing impossible lets say
842387,59402131,2016-01-10,49082421,Christna,Adam was very friendly and helpful. The area is very central and in walking distance to everything. A great thanks to Adam for walking the extra mile for excellent service.
842387,60074606,2016-01-18,54030498,Chloe,Incredibly welcoming and helpful host in what has become my favourite neighbourhood in Cape Town. Great place to meet other tourists passing through the city.
842387,63839656,2016-02-27,45052597,Anke,Kapstadt ist eine groartige Stadt und auf jeden Fall eine Reise wert. Vor allem wenn ihr bei Adam unterkommt. Er ist ein super Gastgeber und steht jederzeit mit Rat und Tat zur Seite. Die Unterkunft ist in meinem absoluten Lieblingsviertel mit vielen kleinen Geschften und Cafs. Vieles ist fulufig zu erreichen  ansonsten gibt es ganz in der Nhe auch eine Bushaltestelle. Ich habe mich pudelwohl gefhlt und komme sicher wieder 
842387,102099000,2016-09-16,87765430,Jeannine Florence,I had a very nice time at Adams Friendly roommates and a great apartment with a beautiful outside space...
842387,103200120,2016-09-21,35208308,Charlotte,The room was a bit more basic than we expected by seeing the pictures. It was alright though and has everything you need for a stay in Cape Town. The only thing which was a bit disturbing was the noise from the other guests. The house is more a student house than a guesthouse so there was a lot of stumbling early in the morning or late at night  which you could hear loud and clearly from the room. Over all we really enjoyed our stay  especially the neighbourhood is perfect with some nice bars and restaurants and very centrally located to visit town.
842387,106975512,2016-10-09,22536383,Gina,Adam war sehr nett und jederzeit erreichbar. Allerdings waren wir von der Unterkunft total enttuscht. Es ist stilvoll eingerichtet  nur an jeder Ecke schon sehr abgerockt. Das Wasser in der Dusche Floss nicht ab und es war eisig kalt im Zimmer  es steht eine kleine Gasheizung bereit  allerdings darf die nicht in der Nacht an sein also Wollpulli mitnehmen. Wir htten dringend fr die weitere Reiseplanung gutes Internet gebraucht. Leider war die Verbindung meist sehr schwach oder es gab keine. Die Unterkunft knnen wir fr den Preis nicht weiter empfehlen. Wir sind viel am Reisen und in CT gibt es schnere Appartments  die sich weniger nach Hostel anfhlen und bei denen man nicht bereits um 7 uhr vom lrm der Mitbewohner geweckt wird.
842387,141482855,2017-04-03,6125781,Irma,Location is perfect
842387,149004610,2017-05-02,57781435,Francois,The brother of the owner was great and helped us check-in. Close to long street and in a very safe spot. Use Uber if you are in capetown.
842387,167296750,2017-07-06,40262537,Nicolas,In general a nice place big and nice room  big bathroom  nice kitchen and good located with fun people living there. But it has also its flaws sometimes bad wifi  cold in winter  light in bathroom didnt work properly. Value for money still good.
842387,170688189,2017-07-16,138197647,Rahul,Octavia is a wonderful person. Only met Adam on the last day  super cool dude. Adam's house was peaceful  and as expected. The house isn't well insulated and there aren't any electrical heaters so things get very cold in the winter time.
842387,176001737,2017-07-30,44327665,Erika,Fantastic location  in a lovely  quiet residential part of Cape Town. You can walk to most places from here. The place was clean  well managed and Adam was a helpful and approachable host. I met lots of interesting and friendly people who I explored Cape Town with. My room had a shower plus toilet and was roomy  bright and clean. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay at a place where you are likely to meet other people who you can enjoy Cape Town with. It was perfect for me as a solo traveller.
516875,27327207,2015-03-02,6498831,Hkon,Vi hadde et fantastisk opphold i Willems leilighet. Leiligheten framsto som moderne  delikat og ren. Supert med stor balkong  air-condition  sikker garasjeplass i kjelleren  velutstyrt kjkken  vaskemaskin og trketrommel. Smproblemer med internett ble fikset s snart vi ppekte problemene.

842387,215874596,2017-12-02,159695668,Zuzana,This place is just the best what could have happen on our visit in SA. Calm  cosy  clean place where you meet other travelers. Fully equiped kitchen. Comfy beds. Adam is very helpful with all kinds of your needs.
842387,219830800,2017-12-19,159850816,Greg,Adams place is great for shortlong stays and for people traveling as couplessolo. The house is situated proximal to great restaurants  bars and the cableway. Adam is a tuned-in host  this makes for very interesting and informative conversation - especially if youre not from CPT.
842387,225671408,2018-01-07,26644717,Sabrina,Super Lage der Unterkunft  von der man aus schnell zum Tafelberg und zum Strand  als auch zur Cloofstreet kommt. Die Kommunikation mit Adam ist super und die Zimmer sind schn eingerichtet.
842387,229168111,2018-01-22,69837597,Antti,Great location. Walking distance from many of the most popular streets of Cape Town. Adams place is great for a solo traveller as you can meet other like-minded travellers at the house.

842387,252799478,2018-04-12,6318365,Lukasz,Good location with nice shared outdoor space to chat. Probably the place would appreciate a little refurbishment  but still very good value for money. I met there very nice people  and the host was very supportive.

842387,351901477,2018-11-24,111688131,Laura,Ich wurde sehr lieb von Steffi empfangen und hatte auch hausintern viele schne Momente. Mein Anliegen war bei der Unterkunft vor allem in guter Lage ist wirklich sehr nett dort  nette Menschen kennen zu lernen  damit man nicht ganz so allein auf sich gestellt ist. Das hat wunderbar geklappt. Mein gebuchtes Zimmer war auch schn. In der Kche kann hier und da etwas neu organisiert werden  im Groen und Ganzen aber ok. Bei dem Internet sollte man nicht darauf bauen  dass es konstant und gut funktioniert. Das ist wohl aber generell in Kapstadt oft der Fall.
842387,354725960,2018-12-02,222571711,Mirco,Bestens fr einen Aufenthalt in Kapstadt geeignet. Alles was man braucht ist vorhanden. Die Wohnung ist sehr gut und zentral in sicherer Umgebung gelegen.

516875,28400332,2015-03-23,27620138,Michelle,Willem did everything to make sure that my friends and Inhad everythig set for our Cape Town trip. His apartment exceeded my expectations and definitely was the ideally situated. The apartment is surrounded by clubs  bars  cafes  and supermakets that are 2-5 minutes walk from the Rockwell. The Internet was fast and reliable  the staff friendly  the location safe  and a short cab ride from everything I would definitely recommend Willem's apartment at the Rockwell for the best vacation rental
516875,30636675,2015-04-25,4428372,Nicholas,Just to confirm all the other positive reviews. The apartment is great and in a good location. Next to a large grocery store with lots of prepared foods. Walking distance to the VA waterfront. Three rental car companies in a short walking distance and multiple restaurant options. Nice to have the balcony and breeze at night.

842387,865800205711198528,2023-04-09,300004675,Louisa,The house is very well located  restaurants  bars and cafs are close by. It's perfect to meet people  we had a really nice dinner with our flatmates. The house is very old  so the kitchen looks quiet used. But after 4 weeks it really felt like home. We had an amazing time.
842387,1136080498606366006,2024-04-16,298532370,Declan,Good value accommodation  in a great location.
855361,57498390,2015-12-27,3707854,Tanya,Best airbnb ever. The house is stunning - location  decor of the rooms  size of the rooms  luxurious bedding  LOTS of towels like 3 or 4 per person - not the usual 1 small one  fantastically well equipped bathroom. Truly an enchanting apartment to walk into. As well as providing the perfect accommodation  Ashley and his wife Debbie are the perfect hosts. Instant communication  totally responsive to any need    change required - from modifying dates without charging us  to changing layout of the beds and even to retrieve a sim card from the floor while we were out. at the same time  we lived in idyllic seclusion. I can't recommend this house enough.
855361,101994086,2016-09-16,93314680,Nazlee,Excellent Everything from arrival to departure was wonderful The place  the hosts were very friendly and very very helpful and obliging.
855361,137377194,2017-03-15,107474308,Stefan,We had a wonderful stay at Chateau Neuf du Cap especially with our 3-year-old boy who loved to explore the secure surrounding of the house  feeding the fish and playing with the dog. Waking up in the morning with a beautiful view over Hout Bay was a perfect start into the day. Starting from Hout Bay  which is quite central for the Cape region  we did many day trips fitting a 3-year-old day routine. In the mall nearby the house we got everything for our self-catering during our stay. We felt perfectly well and relaxed so it's been a pleasure for us to stay there and would always recommend Chateau Neuf du Cap.
855361,178692081,2017-08-06,33308771,Patricia,Tranquil  relaxing and beautiful  Wonderful  hosts

You really feel at home immediately and relaxed  Very friendly and easy to contact owners. They help you with everything. The pool is nice and big. All appliances are there  so making coffee  doing laundry or the dishes dishwasher is all very easy. When you arrive there are nice flowers put next to the bedside and in the huge bathroom. They really paid attention to details its nicely decorated  all very tastefull. Also we felt very safe here. We had a car so Hout Bay and Cape town and attractions were very easy to acces. Would recommend this place in a heartbeat
855361,310134905,2018-08-19,6352627,Laurie,A beautiful apartment in a great home. Our room looked out on a fountain and garden.

855361,367659443,2019-01-05,169520008,Lisa,We couldnt have wished for more perfect accommodation for our 8 nights in Cape Town. The apartment is beautifully presented  well-equipped and in the ideal location for exploring the city. We felt so safe and comfortable in Hout Bay and Debbie and Ashleys warmth and hospitality was second to none. They were wonderful with our children 7 and 8 and we cant thank them enough for helping to make our stay in South Africa such a memorable one. If youre considering booking this place  dont hesitate. Wed recommend it to our family and friends in a heartbeat.
855361,486755124,2019-07-13,30435467,Rilet,We had a wonderful time at Ashley's and Debbie's. Their place is spacious  beautifully designed  with stunning views.

A few minutes to the shop and beach and just a 15 minute drive to Camps Bay to get you into Cape Town. The house is full of character and has the most beautiful views to wake up to in the morning. Ashley and Debbie were extremely friendly  helpful and really hospitable. They even have a herb garden you can pick your own herbs which is lovely. It was the perfect holiday home for our family and our 2 year old really enjoyed exploring the gardens. I would highly recommend.
855361,719992179,2020-12-31,124954523,Deborah,Thank you for a wonderful stay at Chateau Neuf. It was definitely peaceful and spacious  and very central and surrounded by fantastic beaches and restaurants. The hosts were fantastic.

516875,52405294,2015-10-29,42861678,Hannah,The apartment was really lovely - it's great being in hotel facilities  but in a private apartment.  It's very quiet  but a great base for exploring Cape Town.  It's a 15 minute walk from either the VA Waterfront area or the Central Business District.  Plus there's a good supermarket a 2 minute walk away which is really convenient for self-catering options.  We had everything we needed in the apartment and it was very clean and modern.  I had a great stay  thank you very much.
516875,79889359,2016-06-14,38234978,Fiona,Great view and location. Willem was very helpful when required

516875,98706920,2016-09-01,24153095,Barry,The apartment is very well located and is spacious and quiet. It is very modern with two big bedrooms and two separate bathrooms. The kitchen and living room are open plan and have all the mod cons you may need. Willem got in touch almost immediately after accepting the booking and provided very detailed information on accessing the flat and the parking bay. He was also incredibly flexible on checking in and checking out times which is a novel experience on airbnb. All in all I had a great stay and would not hesitate to stay there again.
516875,101785571,2016-09-15,18485986,Kevin,Willem was on hand for my arrival and even visited me after a few days to check that I was settling in. The apartment is in a super location  very spacious  clean and fabulous views. A really nice area with bars and great restaurants. I have booked to return in October  it's great value and feels like home from home.

516875,114047499,2016-11-15,2573086,Eduardo,Willem and Suzan were very kind and communicative  they answered all our questions and left everything ready.

If you don't want to venture far there are great restaurants just downstairs such as Izakaya Matsuri and  local favourite Vasco Da Gama's or stock up on gourmet treats from the Spar over the road and cook up a storm yourself. Great coffee and breakfast at Bootlegger's in the Piazza too. Everything within easy reach  VA Waterfront just 10 mins walk. Our family had a great week exploring the beautiful city that is Cape Town.
857701,231455856,2018-02-01,18196487,Mert,We adored it here. There is loads of space and the view from the terrace is amazing. Feels very safe and we were sad to leave. Fatima is adorable too. Would stay again no question
516875,126564172,2017-01-12,70358522,Richard,Willem was very kind with us. The apartment was exactly what we were looking for. Just a little thing was wrong  the heat of the pool was out of order.
516875,131019658,2017-02-10,18485986,Kevin,This is my third time staying at Willem's spacious apartment in the last 12 months  it is a perfect location for business and also for a vacation  located in a modern building adjacent to Green point with lots of great restaurants and shops  the apartment is on the upper floor with super views over Cape Town bay and the large terrace gets the sun all day long so super for relaxing. All the amenities of being at home for much less than the cost of a hotel room. Willem communicates very swiftly and nothing is too much trouble for him. Easy walking distance to CTICC for the many conferences and exhibitions and a 3 GBP taxi ride to the fabulous V  A waterfront. Cape Town is a gem of a city and we will be back at Willem's before long.

Everyone writes about the beautiful view it's so true - it is beyond splendid but Fatima's place is much more than that. It's situated in nature and it is wonderful to sit outside on the many available spots - the swing  the deck chairs  the loungers  etc - and just breathe. Thank you Fatima  it was wonderful
857701,616409765941306672,2022-04-30,28841338,Mandy,Bay Splendour was fabulous Fatima was a great host and was very easy to communicate with  The house is in a beautiful location and has the most amazing views We highly recommend staying here

Since the first day and thanks to a very warm Fatima's welcome we felt like at home in her house. It is very children friendly house and garden with an amazing view that you simply cannot have enough of. We found everything we needed and even more in the house. The neighborhood is very calm  friendly and safe  Simon's town and the shopping mall is just 3min. drive which we found very convenient. Fatima was always responsive and very very helpful to us.

516875,213998660,2017-11-24,55179836,Dhivyai,Lovely spacious apartment with nice view. We enjoyed the indoor swimming pool in the building where the apartment is. Check-out was out of way and took sometime  but overall stay was good.

858532,12433307,2014-05-02,13278047,Alban,If you are looking for an apartment in the city center of Cape Town  in a secure residence with excellent facilities  I would definitely recommend this flat.
858532,33906496,2015-06-02,29744424,Sam,I stayed in David's apartment for a little under 3 months. The apartment was wonderful and exactly as described. It has a fantastic location near the city centre. There are a few fresh food markets  many restaurants  and some fantastic coffee shops within short walking distance. David and his family were extremely accommodating and very quick to help with any needs I had during my stay. I will definitely try and stay with them again the next time I am in Cape Town.
858532,71992702,2016-04-30,3055512,Amy,I never met David  but his mom Luz welcomed us to the apartment and was easily accessible for any questions or issues during our three-month stay. The apartment is clean and accommodating for two people  and is very central in Cape Town City Centre. Because it is so central  the area can be loud at times. It is easy to get to most places in the city by foot from the apartment. There is a contractual procedure for check-in and check-out  and you must purchase internet access.
858532,124899246,2017-01-03,8000190,Henrik,We got a great welcoming from Davids mother Luz and she showed us around the flat and building. Great pool area  two different gyms and the flat is exactly the way we expected it to be.
516875,233553753,2018-02-10,103226850,Margaret,Great place. Amazing view from the balcony. Location is superb with all the restaurants and pubs. Great host. Slightly dark bedrooms with windows opening to the hotel corridor. Overall highly recommended. Thanks Willem

516875,237506738,2018-02-23,11007339,Andre,Willem was a great host. Prompt comms and very responsive. Would stay again.
516875,241434421,2018-03-09,14996603,Chris,The apartment is spacious and is in a great location . The hotel bar is great in both service and food. Willem was a great host  being quick to communicate and assist and help anytime needed .
516875,250196013,2018-04-04,127065297,Sys,Det var et super dejligt sted. Roligt om natten og ca 15-20 min gtur fra VA Waterfront og det samme ca til Long Street. S dejligt centralt og midt imellem. Kkkenet var veludstyret og vi boede lige op og ned af et strre supermarked s det var nemt for os at handle ind.
516875,315967049,2018-08-30,10794867,G.T.,We had a great stay in Willem's apartment The view is simply stunning We couldn't get enough of it The apartment is spacious and very very comfortable.  We also loved the fact that it is very central  in the middle of city life. Lots of nice bars and restaurants in the vicinity  giving the area a very trendy vibe. The Waterkant is a very nice area and is the  place to be in Cape Town. It offers vibrant nightlife and it is the place where everything happens. The apartment itself is quiet and tranquil  so whenever we had enough of the city vibe we could relax in peace and enjoy the stunning view. Willem himself is a perfect host. He invited us for drinks at check in  and he gave us lots of tips for our stay. He even introduced us to some outdoor activities with locals which are not on the standard tourist list of things to do. Next time we will surely go back to Willem's place Highly recommended.
516875,348258204,2018-11-13,131675799,Femi,I had great time staying at Willem's place  its a nice a large flat located in a very central location in town  close to many stores and other amenities.
516875,350412599,2018-11-19,4140641,Jonathan,Willems place is perfect for a business or holiday trip.  Couldnt be a better location - walking distance to full CBD but also to the cafes and galleries of Waterkant.  Willem is also highly responsive and available when and if you need him.
516875,366747243,2019-01-03,5705437,Aby,We're a family of 4 with 2 teenagers. The apartment is a few minutes drive from the VA also walkable. It has all the amenities we needed - washer and dryer in particular were very useful. Bedrooms were on the smaller side but comfortable. Plenty of pillows  towels  etc. The apartment gets lots of nice sun and is airy if you open the balcony sliding doors. The building itself was well laid out and the foyer on every floor was nice and open. We had rented a large van and the parking was perfect and easily accessible. Just a 2 minute walk away is a mall called Cape Quarter with a large gym if you require more machines than what is available in the building gym  and nice shops including a Spar Supermarket that had everything we needed. There are also some great restaurant within a 5 minutes walking radius. Willem was a great host and took care of everything we needed. Would recommend it.
516875,368128970,2019-01-06,46237696,Helene,Excellent location.

516875,565059789,2019-11-17,277955281,Omar,Willem was very prompt in responding to questions and ensured that he was there when we checked in. The flat is very neat. It is in a great location and is very secure. There is 24 hours concierge on the ground floor of the hotel where this flat is located also the lifts of the flat only operate if you have the key fob. Also there are nice restaurants and malls just next door. The area where this flat is located also seemed very safe.
516875,588946471,2020-01-05,165044197,Jean-Luc,Appartement parfaitement situ et surtout trs agrable avec une salle de sjour ouvert sur un balcon ... face  Victoria Waterfront
858532,210764940,2017-11-11,53526584,Alwi,It was my second stay at this beautiful appartement. I stayed in the appartement last year for several weeks and it was clear that if Im coming back to Cape Town Ill return to  my home away from home. Its safe  tidy  friendly and located in the heart of Cape Town. I would love to come back someday
858532,224504051,2018-01-03,22865887,Katie,David's place is very central  check in process is more lengthy than what we've experienced before. Weekly cleaning was lovely

858532,423758344,2019-03-15,42849570,Petrus,My colleague from Germany stayed at David's place for 1.5 months. She enjoyed her time in Cape Town and found the apartment ideal as a single woman. Thanks David  for making this visit so easy.
858532,449702726,2019-05-07,1574350,Brian,My girlfriend and I stayed in this apartment for over a month while we were in Cape Town. The building is awesome  and the apartment was a good value for a longer stay. Location was convenient  but did get sketchy outside at night  as is typical for this neighborhood. Nice that we were able to use a parking spot for some of the stay. Other than some minor issues we had with mandatory weekly cleanings that would take a long time  we had a good stay. Would recommend  but wish the host was more flexible with cleaning schedules and expectations for longer stay guests.
858532,479611097,2019-07-01,169027349,Lydia,Hte trs accueillant et trs  lcoute  merci pour tout.

Very kind people and the check in process was smooth. If I had any questions  the hosts were immediate in responding. The apartment had all the amenities for a long stay. There is access to a Gym and Swimming Pool which I really enjoyed. I wish to thank Andrez and Luz for the great service received. I can recommend the apartment to anyone.
858532,804841180467557680,2023-01-15,23555243,Sophie,Luz is heel vriendelijk  ze stond me al op te wachten bij het inchecken en geeft een uitgebreide rondleiding. Het appartement is schoon en voelt ruim aan. Ligt midden in het centrum van Kaapstad en alles is goed bereikbaar. Elke week komt een schoonmaakster langs  dat is echt een bonus Luz reageert goed en snel op feedback  het matras was wat oud en aan vervanging toe  toen ik dit aangaf heeft ze direct een nieuwe geregeld
858532,834617029228786430,2023-02-25,8190244,Carolina,Great apartment in the best area. It's close to main attractions  surrounded by many nice restaurants and nightlife. We were a couple working both from home  the internet was very good and we felt very comfortable. The best thing is that the apartment doesn't have load shedding so you always have electricity. Luz Zoraida and her husband were very welcoming and made us feel like home. We recommend it a 100

516875,713605998707284944,2022-09-11,477177104,Sagren,The host was excellent  the advertised  apartment pics don't do justice it is everything advertised and a whole lot more.

516875,782552736305753019,2022-12-15,238941845,Caelene,Donovan is a fantastic host. Our other accommodation fell through and within 15 minutes of sending an enquiry to Donovan he was on site and had us checked in. He communicates very well and goes the extra mile. The apartment is very nice and has everything you need. Its located in a great building and great location.

861257,54223378,2015-11-16,37572091,Esther,Nice place and clean room to stay in. Adam is a friendly host and gave us a warm welcome.

861257,58828884,2016-01-05,10753886,Hannelie,Adam was very helpful and accomodating. Highly recommend this spot
861257,65871904,2016-03-17,14896013,Fabola,Gardens is wonderful neighborhood  near the shops  nightlife and close to the beach. Adam is attentive and great host. The place is nice and spacious. Worth it for those who want to meet new people and enjoy the city heart.
861257,106229984,2016-10-04,6455434,Angie,Adam was super friendly. He spent time answering my questions  showed me around the house and was great over all.  The bed was comfortable and cozy  I loved it.  The room was cute  and I enjoyed hanging out on the patio area. Next time I visit cape town  I will stay with Adam again.
861257,111438346,2016-10-31,100145621,Axel,Adam was very welcoming and gave us a great intro to the city. The location is very good although quite hard for taxi drivers to find  very close to buzzling streets with restaurants  coffee shops and bars. Also  Adam's place is a good place to meet new people to share experiences and tips about the city and its surroundings.
861257,126586016,2017-01-13,29899174,Jorg,We stayed 6 weeks at Adams place  in a room with private bathroom. We loved it It's in a beautiful and safe neighborhood. The house is comfortable  cosy and the garden is nice to chill  have breakfast  start a fire  braai or have some drinks with the other guests We saw a lot of people come and go and Adam is a great host. He is willing to help you if needed and is always available. Highly recommended
861257,129755538,2017-02-02,109116119,Heiko,Nice place in perfect location. We would definitely come back.
861257,132300004,2017-02-17,44404930,Fleur,Adam was a really nice host  reacts very quick. Location is awesome  close to nice restaurants and other nice spots. Also felt really safe there

861257,153214044,2017-05-20,3876833,Tina,Perfect guesthouse to stay in CAPETOWN. Amazing big rooms and Adam is the best host. Totally recommend.
861257,214591768,2017-11-26,152058518,Julian,If you are looking for a place to meet cool people and have fun together this is the place to be. Very close to the nightlife and lots of restaurants around. This place has a good hostel vibe going if you enjoy that. Only downside for me were that the toilet can only be flushed with buckets. Overall a comfortable place to stay
861257,225628055,2018-01-07,4723801,Kinga,Adam's place is in a great location close to Table Mountain and Kloof Street on a quiet side street. There is a kitchen with all necessary amenities to cook for yourself  a lovely garden patio and rooms with very high ceilings I personally love high ceilings. Adam himself is a great person to chat with and vey friendly. Wish I could stay here longer.
861257,231057050,2018-01-30,4978155,Jesse,Highly recommend staying at Adam's guesthouse. Great location and ability to meet other travelers  all while having your own spacious room.
861257,232523915,2018-02-05,16805166,Carolin,I had a great time at Adam's guesthouse. Since I extended my stay after one week for another 6 days I got to see three of the six rooms and each of it is comfy  clean and very charming. You always have your privacy but the chance to meet people in the big kitchen or backyard  which is a nice alternative to other hostels. The communication with Adam was perfect. He replies immediately and is always available for advice  questions or just a chat. The area around is beautiful  feels very safe and quiet and at same time just next door to Kloofstreet with it's bars  cafe's and restaurants. Perfect place to be and to explore the city.
861257,234537664,2018-02-13,51869825,Daniella,Great

861257,573104587,2019-12-05,5979510,Yvonne,Great neighborhood in Tamboerskloof. Super nice host. Nice rooms. You have to be aware that its like a big shared apartment with other guests. So you get in touch with people a lot and also hear noises - it all depends on how everybody behaves 
861257,586625351,2020-01-02,13148116,Serge,Adams place is a perfect place to enjoy your time in Cape Town Very close to Table Mountain road   3 km from the city centre and a safe area to stay in. Very easy to get to and possibility to use your own car or Uber. The rooms are large  clean with the possibility to cook and wash.

861257,610396953,2020-02-24,4466814,Andrea,Super Gastgeber und tolle Lage. Adam ist immer erreichbar und sorgt fr schnelle Lsungen. Aus dem Haus kann man mehr rausholen  der Aussenbereich ist schn aber leider nicht gengend gepflegt. Die Lage ist top und das Haus sehr schn. Die Zimmer sind dem Preis entsprechend ausgestattet.
861257,615465019,2020-03-08,33258934,Ashley,Quick responses from Adam and it was a great place to stay. Very clean and a cool environment.

861257,539673450620144029,2022-01-14,134292724,Solenn,We had a lovely stay. Adam was very easy going and allowed us to keep our puppy even though we asked at the last minute. We are very grateful for that. We liked that the kitchen was shared and we got to meet some friendly people. Thank you for being so accessible and easy going Adam.
861257,543931730626555699,2022-01-20,45998325,Abigail,Wonderful location in Tamboerskloof
861257,546842569046549061,2022-01-24,1836619,Theo,Great house in a quiet residential area. Lovely garden. For the price  its good value for money. There was an issue with the shower in my room  the shower head fell off and whacked me just below the eye  hopefully this is fixed soon.
861257,607777319889357179,2022-04-18,16651864,Willem,This was a great place to stay  very centrally located  big rooms  good amenities. The fact that you share the place with other people was definitely a positive and the people who stayed there while I was there were very friendly and welcoming.
861257,788175197916802174,2022-12-23,350264456,Rammin,Adam is a helpful host and the location is perfect. Its  a great way to meet new people and feel a bit at home. If youre a light sleeper bring earplugs Overall good value for money.
861257,1094763159487732038,2024-02-19,2918553,Anouk,Great place to stay. Basic  clean and very good value for money. Hall can be bit noisy due to the wooden floor  but furthermore everything I expected. Big plus is the location  the neighborhood is quite and great Thanks Adam for having me.

875916,800561404437296853,2023-01-09,337051095,Chris,All perfect
875916,826626419670217870,2023-02-14,11295331,Pierre,Maureen is very friendly and controls everything. If you want to stay in an old style boarding school then this is your place. The place needs upgrading and a clean bathroom.. especially the shower and shower door.. old kitchen .. for the rest perfect but no privacy we like more an Airbnb more quiet without rules and where the tenant is not living on the premises we never experienced this kind of  Airbnb  we rent also out an Airbnb and we like to feel the people at home and give them tips how to make there stay comfortable 
875916,829502846836505264,2023-02-18,38994743,Stefan,Everything was perfect 
875916,872286321377469401,2023-04-18,83668286,Emilia Isabel,Thanks Maureen and Llandudno for a wonderful time
875916,903414287574339223,2023-05-31,450866771,Margaret Eliana,Thank you Maureen  for the comfortable and practical long stay  and for the consistent communication and hospitality. The location was perfect for us. Regards  Eliana
518545,289760206,2018-07-13,192895374,Jason,We had issues the electricity running out twice.
518545,495545346327090649,2021-11-14,371388435,Max,It was very unclean  dirty and it smells very disgusting. The furniture was old and partially damaged. I can't recommend this apartment. We leaved during 1 12 hour. Jaco was very cooperative and agree to pay our money back. We were glad to move back.
518545,688871869139871517,2022-08-08,473110215,Anele,it wax awesome...
518726,3622987,2013-02-26,4842886,Stuart,David and Pat are very gracious hosts at their farm high up in the Durbanville Hills. I stayed two weeks with them in February 2013 when I was working on a project at Tygerberg Hospital. It was great to return to such a relaxing atmosphere after a day's work  surrounded by horses  peacocks  and the host's collection of dogs and cats. The house looks out to a beautiful panorama of the Hottentot Mountains. The rooms are spacious  new  and clean the living room is amazing  with a high thatched roof ceiling. Shops and restaurants are five minute's drive away. The hosts make you immediately feel at home. It is a great stay for guests that are laid back and want to have an 'out of town' feel while they are still in immediate striking distance of Cape Town.
875916,1046958109209308454,2023-12-15,39243559,Uwe,Tolle Lage in der Nhe des wunderschnen Strandes. Sehr ruhig  aber gute Anbindung nach Hout Bay oder Camps Bay. Maureen ist sehr freundlich  hilfsbereit und jederzeit erreichbar. Die Wegbeschreibung ist einfach. Das Apartment mit schnem Blick auf die Bay.
875916,1094029401617562500,2024-02-18,19691114,Greg,Nice place and great location and walkable to the beach.
875916,1108592412678429673,2024-03-09,68663454,Elize,A lovely space in a peaceful area. Easy access to the beach. Maureen was a lovely and responsive host. Thank you for a lovely stay
879450,7485766,2013-09-22,8081594,Tom,Great stay. Friendly and generous hosts. Absolutely nothing to complain about.
879450,8439274,2013-10-30,9579598,Ori,amazing  exactly as described  the location was in the suburbs  15 minutes away from everything like the water front  canal walk  or table mountain etc. etc. lovely family  very caring always felt like home when i talked to Louie and Franki towards the end. highly recommended for any visitors to cape town 1010
879450,8768085,2013-11-17,1594478,Anna,I was looking for a beautiful  quiet place not far from the centre of Cape Town because I needed two weeks to sort things out in my life - and found it  even more. Warm  lovely people  a tasteful studio with private terrace and a stunning view to Table Mountain  beautiful contact with Loukie who took me out with her to visit some open gardens  a ceramic show ect. I really felt at home and my privacy was totally respected. I highly recommend this place  couldn't be better.
879450,9179368,2013-12-11,4032436,Tif,We had a great time at Franki's place. It was absolutely beautiful  clean and in a great area She and her mother are perfect hosts and I look forward to staying there in the future
879450,9317916,2013-12-21,9757074,Annah,Lovely and charming cottage  hosted by lovely and charming family.  The cottage offers everything you may need in a beautiful setting. Very conveniently located. Franki and her Mom where very helpful  and flexible host.
879450,10359359,2014-02-16,8366733,Per Martin,My wife and I had a fantastic month-long stay at Southern Oaks House  thanks in no small measure to the kind and thoughtful hosts. The flat is very fresh - tastefully decorated and flooded with light. The views from the bedroom are superb and the surrounding lush gardens add real tranquility to the place  not to mention the sizeable terrace where we enjoyed many al fresco meals whilst marvelling at the imposing presence that is Table Mountain. The neighbourhood feels very safe and is only a stone's throw away from all that Cape Town has to offer. Amenities  including great gyms  shops and restaurants  are only a couple of minutes drive away. We are extremely pleased that we chose to stay there and can not recommend it highly enough
879450,10874789,2014-03-11,5675790,Nicholas,We had a great time The apartment is beautiful  well maintained  and very private. The location is great  just down the road from a supermarket  cafes etc  and in a very nice neighbourhood. Franki's mom was a great host  very helpful and accommodating. Will definitely be recommending this place to anyone visiting Cape Town.
879450,12689515,2014-05-08,1768562,Michele,I had a fabulous time at the Mountain View Studio Apartment. The place is fantastic - very stylish and comfortable  well-equipped  extremely quiet  and with a stunning view. Franki and Louie are outstanding hosts  always available to assist and advise - they really make you feel at home. I would definitely recommend the Mountain View Studio Apartment if you plan to spend a few days or longer periods in the Cape Town area.
879450,13438594,2014-05-27,9218152,Paula,This apartment is a great find Both Franki and Louie were waiting for me on my arrival and were extremely friendly and helpful. The views from the private terrace are just stunning. You could sit there all day relaxing. The set up was great  you felt safe and secure at all times. Louie was available and worried for me to make sure I was ok. The place felt like home away from home. I would highly recommend this location for someone who is looking for a little place in Cape Town to which you can use your base to explore. It is not in the city center  but I didn't mind this  and taxis are easy and available at anytime to help with your adventures. I would definitely come back to this place.
879450,13955641,2014-06-09,2407109,Jake,Franki and her mom were wonderful. The space was incredible  such a bright little apartment. If you're new to Cape Town  this spot is very much in the suburbs which lends itself to a very quiet stay. It was winter  so we didn't spend too much time on the patio  but the view of Table Mountain  even from the bedroom is unreal. Great place.
879450,21102851,2014-10-11,21996300,Fenella,I visited Mountain View Studio Apartment  not as a tourist  but as a Capetonian needing a temporary home  for me and my baby  while our home was being painted. 'At home' was how I was made to feel for the duration of my stay. I was welcomed warmly and Louie Franki's mom made it clear that she was available and willing to help should I need anything. The Apartment has magnificent Mountain views and is in a quiet  treed area. While the Apartment offers you peace  it is centrally located - 15 minutes drive to the city centre in one direction and 15 minutes to beautiful False Bay in the other direction. Franki and her mom are an amazing team and are natural hosts.
879450,23236136,2014-11-26,184638,Kristy,Franki and Louie were absolutely lovely hosts. The whole family is friendly and gracious. They went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and at home.  The space itself was equally lovely. The guest house was clean  quiet  tranquil and has beautiful views.  I highly recommend staying here.
879450,23815247,2014-12-11,23415373,Karen,What a lovely experience  Louie welcomed us  showed us around so that we could get oriented and provided more than the basics coffee  tea  milk  yoghurt  muesli  fruit we could settle in right away.  The apartment is conveniently located so that we could get around easily.  There are bus and train stations close by but we ended up taking taxis for the most part.  We also rented a car for the last couple of days after our conference was over and were able to park on the property.  We did enjoy being able to walk to a nice little mall area close by where we had a number of very good meals.  Our only regret is that we did not spend more time in our beautiful little abode since we were running around all day but early mornings on the veranda with a cup of coffee sizing up the mood of the day and the mountain were a great treat.  A glass of wine in the coolness of the evening air after a day of activity in the heat was also wonderful.  Everything was clean  comfortable and aesthetically pleasing.  Louie was there when you needed her but keep a discreet distance the rest of the time.  The bathroom would not work for anyone with mobility issues but we would love to return and next time we'd make sure that we could spend more time enjoying the views and the peaceful quiet of the area.  Thank you Franki and Louie for a perfect stay.
879450,25989329,2015-02-01,9579598,Ori,Thank you for the stay  the apartment is exactly as described The host are the nicest people  and in general what a great experience to be in Cape Town with this apartment  highly recommended
879450,26492674,2015-02-14,1927665,Christopher,Very welcoming host.  Apartment was exactly as described  which is to say really nice.  Perfect location for exploring all areas of Cape Town without feeling like you're in the center of a city.
879450,27690467,2015-03-09,13783537,Nadia,We booked this property for my father-in-law when he came to visit and he was thrilled with the warm welcome he received into the perfect home away from home.  The apartment is as amazing as the pictures portray and the hosts were onsite and super helpful. The apartment is exceptionally well located near shops  restaurants and parks and is a stone throw away from Newlands station  cricket ground and rugby stadium. The apartment is bright and well equipped for a relaxing stay in Cape Town. It has easy access to the hustle and bustle of the citysurrounding areas but you can retreat to the peaceful suburbs for some rest at the end of the day.
879450,28186492,2015-03-19,29089959,La,Great stay. I was welcomed by the owners and shown to the apartment. Nice view of the mountain and conveniently situated near Claremont Main Road. Would recommend to friends.
879450,28915971,2015-03-31,29941830,Matome,The host was very friendly and gave us tips on the area. The apartment is very beautiful and has great views. Its also in a great neighbourhood with easily accessible shops and local restaurants. Will surely request to stay there again.
879450,29022297,2015-04-02,18962409,Peter,We enjoyed our stay here. The host went our of her way to make sure everything was okay including acquiring an extra box mattress after we mentioned the bed was too hard. The actual accommodation was very nice  bright  breezy and in a great area.
879450,31013652,2015-04-30,31701919,Adam,Had a great stay at the Mountain View apartment. My wife and I cannot wait to stay there again. Great neighborhood and location Great park for running nearby
879450,36189665,2015-06-26,10642681,Nicole,The mountain view studio is even more gorgeous than the pictures We had an amazing time nestled in this quiet neighborhood in Claremont surrounded by beautiful nature and waking up to majestic Table Mountain out the window. Franki and Louie went out of their way to make us feel right at home with rooibos tea  an extra desk  and a wonderful place to stay. Overall  it was baie lekker very amazing as they say here in South Africa
879450,37197009,2015-07-05,25606557,Doug,Everything was great staying although Franki. The place was exactly as described. I would definitely stay there again.
879450,44525954,2015-08-27,2769337,Alex,What an amazing place. Ideal location for exploring Cape Town--20 minutes from City Bowl  20 minutes from kalk Bay  and convenient to lots of nice stuff in between. The view of the mountain is stunning. the hosts--Franki and he mother--couldn't have been more welcoming. I know people get concerned about security in S. Africa--this is a very  very safe and secure area and set up.
879450,44816674,2015-08-29,5123920,Jacob,Great space  beautiful views and comfortably located.
879450,53128116,2015-11-05,3928414,Matthew,I enjoyed a great stay at this studio apartment in Cape town. The hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful. The studio has a fantastic view of table mountain from the balcony. Would certainly recommend this place to anyone.
879450,53958570,2015-11-15,4158949,Tara,Lovely hosts. Wish we had had time to have tea with them.

879450,54914477,2015-11-25,11440942,Michael,Franki was great Would definitely stay again. Wonderfully appointed.
879450,54975081,2015-11-27,18382731,Althea,This studio apartment just minutes from downtown Cape Town was so perfect  we didn't want to leave. Franki's mother made us feel like family upon arrival and the dogs loved on us as we departed. The patio view of the mountains was beyond gorgeous  the neighborhood was peaceful and clean  and the windows all around gave us great sunlight from sunrise to sunset. I would recommend this home to anyone staying in Cape Town with a car to get around.
879450,59191023,2016-01-08,7357607,Paul,The hosts were brilliant  the flat is brilliant  the location is brilliant I do have to mention that the pool has been filled in due to an expected drought so the description isn't 100 percent accurate. That said louie very kindly arranged for us to use a neighbours pool if we wished. Great stay.
879450,63869848,2016-02-28,20383554,Daniel,I spent almost a month here. It was a wonderful place to stay and the hosts were amazing  welcoming and generous. I would thoroughly recommend this place to others
879450,64875100,2016-03-08,4842886,Stuart,This is a charming  modern apartment with a spectacular view of Table Mountain from its terrace. The apartment is airy and bright  the bed is wonderfully comfortable  and the bathroom has been renovated recently and stylishly. I briefly saw Franki but it was really Louie who was acting as host  and she made me feel welcome and at home right away. My only regret was being too tired to join Louie and Franki for a braai on their stoep Highly recommended.
879450,66482144,2016-03-22,20953628,Martha,Our hosts Franki and Louie were perfect. My father  a native of the Rondebosh neighborhood  absolutely loved the property. It provided a comfortable  secure spot to call home for two weeks. He and I cannot thank Frankie and Louie enough. Hope to make the stay even longer next year  Martha
879450,67009270,2016-03-26,3785010,Laurie,Louie a t trs disponible avant notre arrive et nous a accueillis trs chaleureusement. L'appartement est parfaitement adapt.

879450,75457623,2016-05-21,4842886,Stuart,This was the second time I stayed at this wonderful place in Newlands  with a spectacular view of Table Mountain from the room's private patio. The room has a private entrance and is very clean  well-equipped  and tastefully appointed. It is often difficult for me to meet Louie or Franki since I am working on these trips  but they are always great communicators and friendly presences. Highly recommended  and when I am back  will definitely try to stay here again
879450,114533142,2016-11-19,89343823,Rebecca,Louie was amazing Made us feel right at home from the start and made sure that we were completely comfortable. She took care of all of the small necessities  right down to milk in our fridge She gave us the best advice on where to go and what to see. I would highly recommend staying here.
879450,115505795,2016-11-25,11763639,Kelly,My parents stayed at Franki's place during our trip to Cape Town. They loved the patio with the view of the mountains and were very happy with the accommodation. The kitchen was great for light meals and the place was comfortable and well furnished. We hope to be back again soon.

879450,131683784,2017-02-13,38737033,Joe,Had a really enjoyable two week stay in Cape Town. Claremont is a very safe neighbourhood and we had no trouble at all getting Uber into the city and other suburbs. Lovely apartment with an amazing view of table mountain. Do not hesitate booking here  enjoy the city and everything it has to offer. Great hosts.
879450,133695833,2017-02-24,107391942,Rachel,Lovely apartment with stunning views.  Great location for exploring Cape Town and the stunning surrounding area. So much to see and do.

879450,226924412,2018-01-13,2815732,Tom,Louie and her family were lovely hosts. The apartment was comfortable and filled with natural light. We enjoyed the amazing view of Table Mountain from the balcony. This is a good location for accessing the city and Kirstenbosch Gardens  but you will need a car  there is secure parking. There was a drought in Cape Town and water restrictions whilst we were visiting but Louie made sure we had everything we needed. We would recommend staying here and visiting this diverse and interesting city
518837,360569943,2018-12-21,122991000,Marilyn,A lovely rustic accommodation. A happy place

879450,238599767,2018-02-26,77501,Lynneth,My stay in Louie's studio was perfect The view of Table Mountain from the balcony is breathtaking. The space was clean  open  airy  and wonderfully decorated  just as shown in the pictures. The kitchen was well stocked and I had everything I expected and more to feel right at home. I was able to come and go comfortably throughout my stay  and easily walked or took Uber to all the interesting sites. Louie was welcoming and very responsive to messages prior and during my visit. I would recommend this place and would happily stay here again. Thank you  Louie  for your hospitality
879450,240981184,2018-03-07,43135751,Yaseera,Louie is such a lovely  bright personality and her little apartment was just the same The incredible mountain view from the patio won me over completely and immediately became my early morning coffee spot just so I could catch the sunrise. The apartment was comfortable  well furnished and bright with plenty of windows and reliable WiFi. Louie was very accommodating and hospitable and I had the pleasure of meeting her wonderful daughter Marguerite as well.
879450,242982848,2018-03-14,89471142,Kathrin,Louie ist eine wirklich wunderbare Gastgeberin Sie ist sehr herzlich und hat immer ein offenes Ohr. Vielen Dank fr den schnen Abend  die interessanten Gesprche  das leckere Essen und den Wein Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefhlt. Das Apartment ist hell und sauber und schn eingerichtet  von der Terrasse hat man einen tollen Blick auf den Tafelberg. Die Umgebung ist eine Wohngegend  ein Auto ist empfehlenswert. Aber man kann von dort alles gut erreichen  zum Beispiel den Botanischen Garten oder die Weinregion Constantia  in die City Bowl fhrt man je nach Verkehr 15-20 min. Im nheren Umkreis gibt es aber auch einige schne Cafs und Restaurants. Wir bedanken uns ganz herzlich bei Louie und kommen gern wieder.
879450,298163820,2018-07-29,166745845,Laura,The space is gorgeous filled with natural light. Great views of the mountain. It was truly wonderful staying there.

It is in a quiet neighborhood and close to a nice little shopping centre where you can get what you need. Thanks again Louie for making our stay in Cape Town a wonderful experience.
879450,337973046,2018-10-18,6182596,Gunnar,I stayed one months in Louie's wonderful Loft apartment and absolutely enjoyed it. The room is spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is large and clean. I loved sitting on the outside terrace overlooking Table Mountain. Great to watch the sunrise I can totally recommend staying with Louie.
879450,440692229,2019-04-21,203774361,Zachary,Louie is fantastic  we landed super late and she stayed up to greet us. The location was perfect for us  a short walk to the start of Two Oceans in a quiet neighborhood. The view of table mountain from the private patio is hard to beat and you get to pet her cute dogs if youre lucky 
879450,599501434,2020-01-30,19330128,Ribka,Lovely place to stay and lovely host
879450,603322024,2020-02-09,24893741,Greg,Louie's cottage made a great home base while I was in town briefly for work. The bed was super comfortable  and the aircon made for a great sleep during warm summer nights. The view can't be bragged about enough Absolutely awesome mountain views from the patio and inside desk  which made my working hours much more pleasurable. Also the cottage is very private and quiet. Excellent stay and highly recommended.
879450,727258614,2021-01-28,27957529,Alexandra,Louies space is the perfect stay all around I could not be happier with how calm and safe the neighbourhood has and Louie is a joy to get to know The space is extremely stylish and clean and I hope to be back again soon
879450,529426385374800573,2021-12-31,52996602,Michael,Lovely spot in the souther suburbs. Private and relaxing.
879450,586709212193050084,2022-03-20,446602946,Lee,the granny is very friendly
887577,366050743,2019-01-02,91312342,Rachelle,Stay here Except when I want to stay here again - then I want you to stay elsewhere What an idyllic house in an idyllic place. I cannot recommend Matthew and Bridgets house enough. My guests all agreed that it was a vacation of a life time.
887577,589484974,2020-01-06,60522796,Carla,Lovely stay at Bridget's home but beware of the wind in December Bridget is a very hospitable and responsive host. Checkin and checkout with little fuss.  Photos are very accurate - her home was great for a big family stay
518837,361693487,2018-12-24,226537698,Lezanne,We had a lovely stay at Lucindas place. It is basic  spotless and very good value for money. Enjoyed coffee on the stoep overlooking the green belt every morning and was entertained by a family of guinea fowl as well as people walking their dogs to the beach.
518837,364197367,2018-12-30,23133956,Fauziah,My 5-day stay at Lucinda  Shaun has been a pure delight. To start with  the place is the perfect haven to relax  enjoy the view and the nearby ocean in a very quiet neighborhood  as well as to explore the peninsula or even the Winelands on a day-trip basis. As for Lucinda  Shaun  they've wonderful hosts  generously sharing their time for privileged moments of discussion with their friends.
893053,12191608,2014-04-25,2430352,Marta,Everything was perfect. A very nice apartment
893053,14869475,2014-06-28,206087,Jeroen,Great well-equipped apartment  location could not be better mind this is the city centre next to the market so yes  it's buzzing with life - if you want nothing but peace and quiet  go to the countryside. In-your-face view of Table Mountain. Really comfortable. Great balcony. We could really relax here  do our laundry and enjoy the many restaurants in the neighbourhood. The only downside was the parking guard was rather the bully and the parking lot itself turned out to not be high enough for our admittedly huge rooftent-4WD-car max height  2.1 meter  so we had to park it on the street and pay a security guard from a nearby bank to watch over it. Also the security guard of the building itself was kind of paranoid before giving us the key upon arrival even my reservation print-out didn't suffize for him  but Katia solved this with a simple phone call which I  then again  had to pay for myself. All in all  we would stay here again but come by MyCity-bus or taxi  and leave our car behind earlier.
893053,16200363,2014-07-23,6474596,Steve,Katia left fresh flowers and a bottle of wine for us.  She could not greet us as we had a late evening arrival  but she came by the next evening about 530 pm and helped us with the internet which had been difficult.  The apartment's location is outstanding  right on Greenmarket Square within easy walk of many historic sites.  We had an excellent visit to Cape Town which was make easy by the location of the apartment.
893053,19125543,2014-09-07,8515670,Tricia,Katia's flat was beautiful and perfect for my fianc and my stay in Cape Town. The location was ideal  as we were able to park the car the evening we arrived and walk everywhere we wanted for the two days we were there. Very ideal in the city While you do hear a bit of street noise  especially at night  the building itself was VERY secure  so we were able to sleep easy. Lovely stay overall
893053,22852585,2014-11-16,19612504,Nicole,Das Apartment ist sehr modern eingerichtet . Die longstreet ist um die Ecke und somit ist man direkt mittendrin . Bars   Pubs   Restaurants in unmittelbarer Nhe . Nachts etwas laut . Haben uns wohl gefhlt .
893053,23511684,2014-12-02,2801555,Sharda,Lovely place Perfect location. Great views. A very comfortable  tasteful and easy place to rest in Cape Town. Katia was super attentive and available to help out  whenever needed. I would stay there again for sure.
893053,27155900,2015-02-27,20457422,Mathias,Schnes modernes Apartment in einer super Gegend Wir haben uns direkt wohl gefhlt. Die Nhe zur Long Street ist perfekt nur an den Lrmpegel muss man sich gewhnen Wir knnen das Apartment nur weiter empfehlen

Walking distance to a lot of restaurants  bars and markets and a very close drive to most everything else. The apartment was clean and open with a great view of the town. Would definitely recommend
893053,55935922,2015-12-07,48562778,Nicole Marie,The location is central and the place is beautiful  Katia is a great host. There are many clubs nearby  if you're a light or troubled sleeper  I might avoid this location.
893053,66810925,2016-03-24,5139676,Nushmia,Katia was very helpful  the location was ideal.
893053,116384750,2016-11-30,42645691,Shan,Had a great stay at this great location Katia kindly arranged transport from the airport and was brilliant at communicating with us before the trip. She greeted us with a bottle of wine and plenty of advice for things to do in the city. The flat is fantastic - unbeatable location with a great view. Just be aware it's in a very lively spot so there is a lot of noisy nightlight but great if that's what you're after. Also  wifi is extra. It is also very secure  especially if you're renting a car  couldn't ask for a better parking spot in the middle of the city. Would definitely recommend as a place to stay.
893053,159205091,2017-06-10,133913940,Grant,Fantastic stay in a great apartment with great views  great location and a great host
518837,366038102,2019-01-02,232319453,Andrea,Great escape. Gorgeous little spot  feels like you're in the middle of nowhere although you're still walking distance from the beach and shops.
518837,401825780,2019-01-16,231743587,Gary,Worthwhile and great value  enjoyed much  excellent stay.
518837,404247929,2019-01-23,21901884,Catherine,This is a great space with a comfortable bed  spacious bathroom and lovely views from the sitting room and kitchen. The verandah is great and we enjoyed hanging out there and enjoying the seastars. The  property is effectively an annex of the main house set in a quiet area with easy access to the beach. We were able to park just outside the house and the area felt very safe.
893053,184868704,2017-08-20,138734792,Darren,Katia was friendly and informative. The apartment was spacious  clean and comfortable. However  the views are the real selling point and they are amazing
893053,203462434,2017-10-15,440022,Petter,A fantastic place. I saw some comments about noise before I booked  but really This is a big city and not the country side. Awesome location  awesome views and a great helpful host

893053,601710030,2020-02-04,6901397,Derek,Nice apartment   beautiful views. The square below is a bit hectic at night though and didnt feel quite safe going outside after dark. But otherwise  the apartment itself was amazing.

893053,1014383829026638869,2023-10-31,32595803,Michael,Needs a lot of maintenance. 4 different keys required to get in and out  kind of excessive. Water pressure is poor. Not very clean. Parking is driving up in a circle 8 times kind of annoying
893053,1082432066679225171,2024-02-02,47574538,Mark,Katya was wonderful.  Very responsive   proactive. She was helpful regarding the electricity units   cleaning the apartment  among other..   All in all  a great host and a great apartment.

518837,568918621,2019-11-25,30910621,Eva,I think this is the way airbnb was originally supposed to be. Lucinda and Shaun welcomed us into their home as guests and gave us the feeling we were so welcome and at home  10 thousand kilometres away from our own. It definitely gave our visit to Kommetjie an extra dimension and if we ever come back  this will be the home were we want to stay again.
518837,572607015,2019-12-03,93822108,Wessel,Wonderful cozy apartment in a beautiful setting  ideal for a relaxing get away.

518837,649385157,2020-08-10,331047449,Chad,Our weekend away at Lucindas was really stunning. The location is ideal and waking up to the view of the ocean every day really was a treat. The beach was walking distance away and the greenbelt alongside the area brought some beautiful birds and wildlife. A very cozy and comfortable stay

The best part of our days was sitting on the deck enjoying the quiet  beautiful garden and exceptional view  we only wish we could have spent more time here Highly recommend.
518837,736621206,2021-03-06,13959602,Heather,Lucinda's place is a small sanctuary of tranquility with beautiful views of the ocean. The succulent garden and wooden deck add further elements of rustical charm. One definitely feels at home
518837,427283534012560514,2021-08-12,88532971,Mike  Chels,Great space and wonderful location
518837,507042474880943335,2021-11-30,41649897,Jacqueline,Brilliant find. Perfect location and beautiful view of the ocean. Clean  comfortable and more spacious than it looks in the pics. Lucinda and Shaun are lovely and always on hand to help. Can't recommend highly enough.
518837,526582280002484597,2021-12-27,64422960,Lyle,Great place to stay while in Prague
897063,5523595,2013-07-04,4748061,S.,Ian's place is wonderfully located - it is located in greenpoint  not far from the waterfront and the city centre- you cannot get a better location for the price. The flat is wonderfully decorated and looks better than the pictures. The view is wonderful and Ian has now built an extension  verandah so that guests can enjoy the view even more. Ian doesn't live in the flat and gives you all the privacy you need. He is kind  lovely and a wonderful soul - he felt like a long lost brother or uncle Look no further than Ian's place.
897063,6215678,2013-08-04,1310982,Serene,Ian has got an apartment anyone would envy. A beautiful city view greets you every morning. I would definitely recommend an upgrade to his other bigger room with en-suite toilet. It is conveniently located with a lot of famous eateries in the area. There are a number  of steps to get to his apartment - a good preparation for the hike up Table Mountain. 
897063,7111086,2013-09-07,5027603,Janet,Ian was the best possible host for my 2 friends and me We connected immediately because of his welcoming manner when he picked us up at the airport and his great sense of humor.  His apartment was comfortable and close to city centers with great views. He took us on tours of Cape Town and surrounding areas every day and even cooked 2 meals for us. We had some very interesting conversations and appreciated the helpful information he gave us. We consider him a friend now and hope to host him some time soon in Oregon. Jan Rowe
897063,7485581,2013-09-22,8071111,Reini,We had a wonderful stay in Cape Town. Ian himself was not there but he left us a perfect apartment and loads of brochures and a welcome letter. We felt at home. We surely come back and try to see more of Cape Town and meet Ian personally.
897063,8324184,2013-10-26,6006838,Eduard,We had a wonderful time in Cape town. Ian is an kind and excellent host. I can higly recommend this lovely spelled with pure british accent accomodation to other airbnb members 
897063,8597406,2013-11-07,8570465,Julien,We had a wonderful time staying at Ian's.

And it's perfect for watching sunset over Robben Island We couldn't recommand more staying at Ian's.
518837,579475259590186353,2022-03-10,125848087,Muriel,Lucinda is a great lady and very helpful for all kinds of local information.
518837,599044996885845489,2022-04-06,422406953,Christopher,Lucinda is lovely.  Always eager to help if needed.  Communication was clear.  I had an accident last year and had to cancel  Lucinda dealt with cancellation for me  such a huge help whilst I was going through so much trauma at the time.
518837,604153904681762741,2022-04-13,678871,Julian,Beautiful  tranquil spot a few steps away from the beach. Host was very friendly and helpful. We had a great stay.

518837,625112034871529303,2022-05-12,44674868,Chris,Incredibly cute and quaint. The constant sound of the ocean was magical. Thanks for being so friendly Lucinda
518837,642583264062317365,2022-06-05,58671103,Merete,This is an absolute beautiful little gem located in walking distance to what in my opinion is one of the most beautiful beaches in Cape Town. Lucinda and Shaun made my stay very comfortable and easy  and I would love to come back and relax soon
518837,648289594724175356,2022-06-13,9439017,Alessandro,The cottage is excellent for two people. location is great. sea view and green around. hosts are helpful and kind. we recommend it

897063,8740111,2013-11-15,467235,D. A.,You can't find a more appealing host than Ian  who seems determined to do everything reasonably possible to make your stay in Cape Town enjoyable. He's knowledgeable of all-things-Cape Town and even beyond  and may even bend his demanding schedule to provide you with a tour of the lovely city's sights and transport you tofrom the airport. He was even so kind as to have his tidy housekeeper provide us with laundry service. His flat's location and views are impeccable. Public transportation and inexpensive taxis are readily available  and the location is superb for walking to the VA waterfront or plethora of intimate cafes and shopping amenities. Be advised  however  that you'll have to scale 63 steps from the sidewalk before you land inside Ian's digs  but it's totally worth the hike...you can work off some of the delicious and inexpensive seafood he'll direct you to The only things we'd recommend are that you should 1 upgrade to the larger bedroom with true en suite amenities if available and a breathtaking floor-to-ceiling view of the harbor  and 2 extend your stay as long as possible  because Ian represents the very best in impeccable  kind  and honest hosts whom anyone would be blessed to experience first hand.
897063,9825666,2014-01-13,8761072,Joel  Terri,My wife and I traveled throughout South Africa for a month and Ian's place was without a doubt one of the nicest places we stayed at. Not to mention that Ian is extremely helpful and will give you an abundance of information about what to do in and around Cape Town Lastly  the view from the balcony is beautiful and a great way to start your day
897063,9994331,2014-01-24,9146509,Geraldine,We spent 8 days in Cape Town and found our host  Ian  very  very helpful and friendly from the minute he picked us up at the airport. The flat and the views from it met our expectations. We saw Ian most evenings and he was always willing to give advice and to offer his services. We found Ian a really nice person and he enhanced our stay enormously. We will return.
897063,10190477,2014-02-05,175691,Terry,I had eight delightful nights in Ian's incredible apartment.  Ian is a very generous and kind host who goes out of his way to make his guests feel at home.  Location would be hard to beat ten minutes down the hill to the best coffee house in Cape Town and twenty minutes down to waterfront and all the great restaurants....the 105 bus stops a few meters away and goes into downtown and out to Sea Point....it was a lucky find and wonderful memories of my stay at Ian's
897063,10476101,2014-02-21,9738645,Uwe,Ian was a very special warm and gentle person. His hospitality was great. Highly recommendation.
897063,10970442,2014-03-15,12947508,Genevieve,I booked a last minute trip as a solo traveler to Cape Town  and could not have had a better stay.  Ian is absolutely lovely- picked me up from the airport  showed me around town and recommended some great restaurants.  His place has a phenomenal view of the VA Waterfront and the World Cup Stadium  and is very centrally located. I cannot recommend Ian highly enough- he went above and beyond to make my stay memorable and to share the best of Cape Town with a first time visitor.
897063,12802730,2014-05-11,11585880,Jackie,A great host and an amazing place with spectacular views. I was travelling on my own and Ian kindly picked me up from the airport at no charge. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Ian you are a sweetheart and I can't thank you enough xx
518837,738271817276872752,2022-10-15,74148024,David,Wow - what an absoluately stunning place drenched in beauty. What a great feeling  sitting on the porch watching weavers weave their nests  the sound of hundreds of birds  the smell of fresh ocean air and gazing over the wetland to the site of the sun setting over the Atlantic. And Lucinda and her husband are amazing hosts.
518837,754147204766882247,2022-11-06,75133146,Stephen,Great communication  relaxed holiday vibes  just what we needed.

897063,13553655,2014-05-30,15775316,Loic,Staying at Ian's apartment was my first experience with airbnb and it was a complete success. Ian is a very friendly  delightful  helpful host and the apartment is ideally located  big  calm. Spending time reading bools in the living-room  seeing the marvellous view on the terrace or talking about various topics with Ian was a great pleasure. He loves life and we love him. Thanks for all Ian and hope to see you again. Take care
518837,778083039972426094,2022-12-09,98873946,Lee,A complete pleasure Thank you Lucinda and Shaun.

518837,850541997484981179,2023-03-19,305006521,Hanlie,Surroundings and view was beautiful but a little overcharged for what you got.
518837,851983021596598847,2023-03-21,23072906,Jayme,1010  great stay. Lucinda was unreal. She even gave us an extended checkout time so we could enjoy the beach before going home 
518837,859969342865871893,2023-04-01,13665998,Sophie,Lovely annex that feels very private. The view of the coast and garden are so beautiful. A great spot to watch the sunset and look at the stars. Lucinda was a super friendly and accommodating host. Solar power means you dont really feel the affects of load shedding during the day.
518837,866542291875482844,2023-04-10,92243875,Robin,The studio is so beautiful and the backyard is peaceful and you have the view on a nice sunset. I will come back

518837,1039010168249854858,2023-12-04,131405920,Kim,This place is actually even nicer than what I was expecting I think you really have to be there to experience the peacefulness surrounded by nature. It was exactly what I was looking for. Super safe aswell.
518837,1092623117988077781,2024-02-16,161557628,Sabrina,We always love it at Shaun and Lucindas beautiful place. It's the scenery  the little pretty apartment and the easy going way  how Shaun and Lucinda handle everything. They are very hospitable and fun to chat with. We love it here and would always come back. Thank you Lucinda and Shaun 
518837,1100577496163330196,2024-02-27,14530890,Irina,Beautiful house with Awesome terrace and a sea view  and very welcoming hosts

897063,19025461,2014-09-05,17045730,Christian,Wir hatten dank Ian einen perfekten Aufenthalt in Kapstadt Er hat uns abgeholt und uns direkt die Umgebung gezeigt. Ian war hilfsbereit  freundlich und immer zur Stelle  wenn wir ihn gebraucht haben. Auerdem hatten wir den besten Blick ber Kapstadt  den man sich vorstellen kann Vielen Dank - wir kommen gerne wieder
518837,1110001494413705288,2024-03-11,21443954,Marielen,We had a wonderful time in Lucinda's cozy place. The location is great as you can easily walk to the beach or go for a run to the lighthouse in the morning. We felt at home from the first moment onwards and enjoyed the friendly conversations with Lucinda and her husband. We will be back 
518837,1114398426591171467,2024-03-17,564406610,Tracey,We have a wonderful stay at Lucinda's cottage. It had everything we needed. The location was lovely...so peaceful and a short walk to the beach and Lucinda was a lovely host
518837,1118701536833496757,2024-03-23,271060346,Lisa,I was looking for a quiet and private space and and that is what I got.
518837,1126008854146832963,2024-04-02,160171802,Martin,Die Lage der Unterkunft ist ideal. Man bentigt nur circa 5 Minuten zum Strand. Wir sind nachmittags herrlich auf der Terrasse gesessen und haben dann bis spt abends den Sonnenuntergang genossen. Die Wohnung hat alles  was man so bentigt und Lucinda ist jederzeit bereit  wenn was fehlt nachzuliefern. Wir knnen die Wohnung wirklich empfehlen.
518837,1143351281506743277,2024-04-26,44227730,Marianne,A peaceful and quiet gem. The view from the deck is amazing and you can hear the ocean crashing from the living room.
543206,9561263,2014-01-02,2376207,Eva,Tolle Location und tolle Gastgeber Wir freuen uns auf ein Wiedersehen Eva und Karl aus Tirol
543206,11452397,2014-04-03,12754012,Joshua,We REALLY enjoyed staying at the 2OceansApartments.  The apartments were clean and perfect size for us.  It is in a great location  The hosts  Anja and Thomas Ostermann were wonderful  Anything we needed they were quick to help out.  They even took the time to show us on the map where some of the common tourist attractions are located.  We would stay there again and would highly recommend them to anyone
543206,581942740,2019-12-26,16618250,Melissa,Fantastic hosts  good location. Basic accommodation but clean and comfortable.
553936,577328548224627856,2022-03-07,57531788,Maureen,It is a nice place to stay  just be sure that if you book a two bedroom place that it is for the two bedrooms and not for just one bedroom wether you a couple or not
897063,22226209,2014-11-02,11369512,Anne,Host was very welcoming and helpful. We felt very relaxed and at home. The location was excellent for getting to town and the waterfront. We felt very safe.
897063,22731304,2014-11-13,20475281,Chris,Kaapstad is een van de mooiste steden die ik ken en als je het voorrecht hebt genomen om bij Ian te gaan overnachten en daar al kunt genieten van het mooiste panorama vanaf het terras of bij de straffe wind door de grote ramen van het waterfront en Robbeneiland  onze minpuntjes zijn kofferopslag en twee schemer leeslampjes bij de bedden En het is een goede uitvalsbasis om de stad te ontdekken en het nachtleven en het goede mooie eten
897063,23744361,2014-12-09,10124885,Dieter,Wir haben eine wunderschne Woche bei Ian im Apartment verbracht. Es war sehr vorteilhaft  dass die Waterfront  und auch die Innenstadt von Kapstadt fusslaeufig zu erreichen sind. Ian ist ein perfekter Gastgeber  der uns mit vielen Tips die Stadt nher gebracht hat.
897063,23940516,2014-12-15,20562463,Sandra,Ian greeted us at the train station and gave us a whirlwind tour of the main city streets and the apartment. He was very friendly and welcoming on that day for one hour  but we did not see him or speak to him again. Based on the description when we'd booked the room in August  we'd thought Ian would be our host and that we had booked a room in his home  but this wasn't the case. We discovered that the other room in the apartment was also a BB room which had been booked by someone else  and that unlike the other room we didn't have a lock on our bedroom door  which made us uncomfortable. Luckily  the other guest left the next day leaving us with the beautiful apartment to ourselves. We would suggest you clarify this detail with Ian  and make sure the room you book can be locked.  The room we booked was at the back of the apartment  which suited us because it is away from the very busy and noisy street at the front where the other room is located. The windows in the back room could use replacing  we had real difficulty sleeping when the neighbours below used their back garden until after 11pm because the sound travelled straight into the room. It seemed that the windows of the room for rent in the front of the building were better insulated and provided more quiet. If you are people who like to stay up late and are not bothered by slight urban noise  this problem could be quite insignificant. The bathroom that comes with this room could also use some renewing BUT the apartment has a fantastic location and we really loved staying there- especially since we had the place to ourselves. The apartment is up a steep set of stairs and would not be suitable for people with mobility problems. We highly recommend this apartment when you  visit Cape Town. It is nicely decorated  has a fantastic deck overlooking the city  and a wonderful central location near the main sights that makes it a FANTASTIC choice.
897063,24222471,2014-12-23,21790392,Rene,Great place to stay in cape town. Marvelous view from the balcony and very good to explore ct on foot.
563459,239301836,2018-03-01,109870646,Samuel,It was perfect. Charming little house with a nice floor plan  little patio and swimming pool. Great location close to everything. Charming and interesting hosts. Thanks again.
563459,242547559,2018-03-12,55416227,Michael,We loved our stay. The accommodation was spacious and well kept. The location is central with easy access to local attractions. Our hosts were very friendly.
563459,248779842,2018-04-01,3776003,Katherine,Had such a lovely visit. Really cute house  with great amenities. Beautiful bathroom  light filled common area  really comfortable bed and perfect location.  Karis was incredibly responsive and helpful. Would absolutely recommend

563459,350364459,2018-11-19,9743053,Claudia,Great house in a safe and quiet neighborhood. We were traveling with our 1 year old baby and it was the perfect accommodation to explore the city  very well equipped  close to cafs  restaurants  supermarket. Karis is a great host  communication was very fast and very kind. Highly recommended
897063,25676669,2015-01-23,17146382,Ilse,Thanks Ian for letting us stay in your beautiful appartment We really had a nice time in Cape Town You could easily walk from the appartment to the Waterfront and to Long Street the party place of Cape Town. We took the Citysightseeing bus the nearest stop is in Waterfront a lot to for example Kirstenbosch  Hout Bay to swim with seals really nice and to the lower cable station of Table Mountain. We also did the tour with Ian to Cape Point and we saw a lot It was beautiful  We really enjoyed our time here  so I would highly recommend to stay with Ian in his appartment with the most amazing view in Cape Town. Greetz Ilse from the Netherlands
897063,26937065,2015-02-22,27100455,Liam,I stayed at the flat during mid February as I was attending a conference at the convention centre. This is an ideal location for getting anywhere in Cake Town I walked everywhere. Ian is a genuine  top bloke. Met me at the airport and gave me a really interesting tour with great insider knowledge of the area before dropping me off at the flat. He arranges for your clothes to be washed and dried for you  without being intrusive. I'm looking forward to creating a way to come back and explore more of Cape Town using this as my Base
897063,27182114,2015-02-27,27929174,Nichlas,We stayed in the flat for 5 days in February. The apartment and view from the balcony is absolutely amazing  and Ian made the experience even better by being so welcoming and kind. The apartment is localized in a nice neighborhood and in walking distance to all the places you want to go to. Ian was very helpful and recommended nice places to dine and drink coffee. Also  Ian knows a lot of the history of his country and it was very interesting to talk to him in general. When we go back we will definitely stay at Ians place again. Did we mention that the view is absolutely amazing
897063,28127447,2015-03-18,27099021,Micha,Good place to stay. The room is just good  but living room and terrace are super cool. Ian is friendly and  helpful. We enjoyed the stay very much.
897063,28408198,2015-03-23,28239250,Marjolijn,Really good experience at Ian his place. Ian is a great host  I wish I had a friend like him back home The apartment is clean  big and has the best view of Cape Town. Ian gives the best recommendations  what to do or to go for breakfast  lunch or diner. If you ever go to Cape Town  stay at his place
897063,29478961,2015-04-08,22338224,Charles,How much more welcome could we have felt than being greeted at the Cape Town airport  after consecutive overnight flights  by our smiling  red-scarved host  He immediately helped us get a simcard  then whisked us off to his place on High Level Road  with its commanding view of the famed V  A waterfront.  It proved an ideal location for our week stay in Cape Town  within walking distance of both the waterfront  downtown  plenty of good cafes  restaurants -- just as advertised.  Once we rented a car  there was no problem parking on the street nearby.  Ian is a man who wears many hats -- both literally  figuratively --  he proved a fount of information about local wisdom  South African culture at large.  Our tour of the wine district with Ian as guide was a highlight.  We would recommend his place to anyone who is not daunted by the 63 step hike up to what I affectionally dubbed 'Ian's Aerie'.  We look forward to meeting him again when we return to Cape Town.
897063,30082192,2015-04-17,14002176,John,Ian metpicked me at the airport and from before I arrived made me feel very welcome He's a font of information as to where things are and what's available in the area from the best coffee Origin  on Hudson St. to sushifish Willoughby's in the VA Mall  and is just an all around relaxing host
563459,411075517,2019-02-11,8741421,Tessa,We had a wonderful stay in Karis family home with our 2 year old. It is a very cosy house with a lovely pool in a great location. Karis was very helpful and always reachable. Although a family normally lives in the house  enough space was left everywhere fridge  cupboard  bathroom  living room so that we didnt feel like we invading anyones place. We can strongly recommend staying at Karis home.
563459,417712442,2019-02-28,226725436,Peter,This place has a lovely big lounge with two sofas and the whole house has a real lived in feel. If you need somewhere to relax this is it and the kitchen is very well equipped.
563459,421272114,2019-03-09,31020178,Molly,A beautiful home  good location  price Thank you for having us

897063,1167964603730182354,2024-05-30,43073340,Camille,I stayed at this lovely Airbnb for a month and it truly made my stay The location is the best  up on the mountain to have this stunning view but close enough to walk to city bowl or waterfront. The Airbnb almost looks like a tinyhouse  a private secluded studio behind an apartment complex. The host was really helpful  getting me extra kitchen utensils when I needed them. The bed is so comfortable  I miss it already. The only negative I have to say is that 13 of the view was obstructed  compared to the pictures because the tree of the neighbor was not cut down host told me it was out of their control  but the view is stunning regardless  got nice pictures Cant wait to return to this Airbnb next year

590826,9668884,2014-01-05,7770270,Mary,I found this apartment to be as was described on Airbnb.  This is a brilliant location  very close to the Waterfront but not in the midst of all the traffic that goes with that area.  There is a water taxi that operates on the canal which will take you directly from the building to the Waterfront area for ZAR 30pp per day.  The building was quiet  secure and all appliances and amenities were in good working order.
590826,36144256,2015-06-25,13112998,Mariam,We really enjoyed our trip to Cape Town. The apartment was as described  very nice and comfy.

606963,20281320,2014-09-27,18446165,Emily,We loved everything about the guest house- great hospitality  fantastic breakfast and a wonderful location. Our room had a nice sitting area outside with a view of the sea. It also had a shower with really good water perssure. We would definitely recommend this to anyone taking a trip along the  coast.
606963,23014737,2014-11-20,9284640,Anja,It is a lovely Guesthouse  perfectly situated  with a nice pool and a stunning view over Kalk Bay. The rooms are simply amazing. We only stayed one night but truly felt welcomed.
606963,25409601,2015-01-15,2638813,Neill,Our stay at Chartfield guesthouse was absolutely stunning 5 star in every way delightful  friendly and helpful staff  delicious comprehensive and healthy breakfast which was superb value for money. Our room was spacious and bright  with crisp white linen  a great shower and super comfortable bed- and spotlessly clean. The guesthouse is a beautiful old restored building with high ceilings and  wooden floors  and is decorated with understated elegance and complemented by beautiful artwork and ceramics. The position is absolutely perfect in the picturesque village of Kalk Bay arguably one of the best spots in South Africa with stunning sea views  a lovely garden and fabulous saltwater pool. Their are so many little touches that we really appreciated- tea or coffee in bed  pool towels  use of a fridge for guests - and a broken window latch being fixed before we even mentioned it. Florian was also wonderfully accommodating by putting an extra bed in our room for our son at a very reasonable cost. I can't recommend this wonderful place highly enough.  It is exceptional value for money--and better than a 5 star hotel because of being small and intimate and the great personal service. Thank you so much for the fabulous stay. Can't wait to come back Kind regards  The Stevensons
606963,25844199,2015-01-27,12686885,Laura,Nestled into the hillside in a great sunny spot  with a lovely pool and and super friendly staff. The room we had was very comfy and had all we wanted for a one night stay.

From a friendly greeting and a personal tour of where we could shop to our check-out  we were treated warmly and responsively. Even though the cottage is close to the main house  our privacy was always respected. Peter and Elfi were the nicest hosts we have encountered after many Airbnb stays. They answered questions promptly and even prepared a braai for us. Finally  the location is very convenient  close to city center and local shopping  with easy access to exploring other areas. Fantastic parking.

The apartment is so central  in Cape Town  Greepoint. 10 minutesaway from the VA Waterfront  stadium and Virgin Active gym. It is surrounded by lovely restaurants and close to the Cape Qauter Shopping centre.  The Apartment is in a very safe  secure Apartment block. I will stay at his Airbnb anytime in the future.
906093,605744947,2020-02-15,42518632,Mk,If you are in CT for either work or pleasure ... this is the place one could opt for. Great location between the central district and the Water Front area. Even though the apartment is on the 4th floor  easy to access and the bus stop right at the gate. Clyde is very easy and reachable even in odd times. Had a good time here. Tks
906093,608956137,2020-02-22,43155596,Johannes,Beautiful view of Table Mountain. Great location close to De Waterkant and popular local restaurants  clubs and bars. Easy to catch the My City bus and also walking distance from the Waterfront. Cozy bachelor's pad and safe with no security issues.
906093,615038712,2020-03-07,102014684,Iracema,The place and the bedroom was good  but the internet was bad. Weve decided  book this bedroom only because we could have been parking safe. When we stayed there we asked to Clyde   in advance  to park inside de building and he didnt  allowed  even we have been asking in advance and we paying. Inclusive told us to parking outside the build  in front of it. the other the day in the morning somebody had stolen from the 4 hubcaps. Because of that the car rental insurance charged us R2920.  Across from the building there are many beggars and drog adicted. So if you want a safe place to parking  dont put it outside.
906093,617895566,2020-03-14,321732282,Mazwi,Great place  Great Service.

906093,444668994287491256,2021-09-05,223694705,Nicole,I had a lovely stay in this flat. It was fitted with all the basics and the bed was incredibly comfortable The kitchen is small  but stocked with enough to cook simply. There are so many great restaurants near-by that cooking was not a high priority. The building staff were really the cherry on top - they were friendly and helpful and a familiar face to talk to at the end of the day. The onsite parking was reasonably priced. Clyde was always helpful and available if any issues came up. This is a great spot in the city  especially for a holiday.
906093,465743117501297529,2021-10-04,153402566,Andre,If I could I would give Clyde a 10 star review  the place is ideally located in the heart of the city  hes quick response  flexibility and professional hospitality would make me me book this stunning place over and over again  oh did I also mention the incredible view of table mountain.

Loved coming down in the mornings and having coffee while looking out over the water and beautiful harbor and nature - by the second morning they had my coffee order memorized. Location can't be beat  all five of the restaurants worth trying are within a block or two. Would love to stay another several days here next year when I'm back. Thank you to Florian consummate host with obvious and genuine appreciation for good hospitality and the team at the guest house for this lovely stay.

Let's just say that Clyde's place is safe  convenient  comfortable  furnished with taste  a great place to come home to. That communication is easy and so positive. That     there is a particular feature that touched my heart. You can discover it if you look. That I am sure I will return here one day.
906093,801252609147756337,2023-01-10,243299844,Andrea,Booked this apartment for my partners mother on her trip to South Africa. We met Clyde- he was very friendly.

906093,819336838469997461,2023-02-04,7415519,Hermann,Very uncomplicated communication with Clyde before  during and after my stay  although we did not meet personally. The flat was absolutely adequate for me as one person for a few days stay in Cape Town. Situated off the main road so not as noisy as anticipated. Stylishly decorated with a wonderful view on Table Mountain. I felt safe  also during regular load-shedding. Clyde arranged secure parking which I appreciated very much. I struggled a bit with water pressure in the very small shower  but was told the bath is to be redone soon. A problem with the drain was solved immediately and without any fuss - which I appreciated very much too. The staff at the security desk was very friendly and helpful - as were other residents I walked into during the course of my stay. The central location was the dealbreaker for me
906093,915063522227750391,2023-06-16,518597457,Patrick,Appreciated

The view of Table Mountain  and the window seat were extra special. The bed is very comfortable. The apartment is well-equipped. The location is great - close to the VA Waterfront  Cape Town CBD  as well as of course  Greenpoint  Three Anchor Bay  Sea Point. Also close to many restaurants and shops. If you are looking for snacks and food to keep on hand in the apartment  Giovanni's Deli is a good place to go and stock up. Clyde is an exceptional host - kind  helpful and great to communicate with.
906093,1088302639331128265,2024-02-10,73904937,Kotryna,Nice and cozy place to stay
911211,8842722,2013-11-21,919022,Joan,Thank you  Doreen and Robert  for your fantastic hospitallity  Arriving very late from Madagascar  we were graciously greeted by Doreen and shown the loft  where a bottle of wine  wheel of brie and strawberries awaited.  The thoughtfulness includes good ground coffee and some milk in the frig to start us off.  But the genuine caring hospitality really shone the second day when we suffered from Mada tummy Robert waited on us  bringing tea with herbs and honey  and getting Vietnamese soup from the near-by restaurant.  We felt like family and wished we could have stayed to enjoy the pool and great shopping in the neighborhood.  Doreen has a special  peaceful haven  with great personal attention.  The spectacular view of Table Mountain and amenities of the Loft were much appreciated.

606963,1112966424212853285,2024-03-15,449685936,Jeanette G,Beautiful  charming guesthouse in beautiful surroundings. Great service. Just Check prior  If you prefer a room inside the main establishment. Our room was outside and the only window was a few metres from the main entrance. Early morning noise with guests booking out very early and no privacy to be able to leave bedroom window open. Otherwise everything else was immaculate and service was great. There are many rooms  so specify the one you prefer.
606963,1167308158413416150,2024-05-29,61251956,Barry,Excellent guesthouse  amazing staff and the breakfast is really incredible. We will definitely be back
911211,11329508,2014-03-30,8127681,Tommy,The Loft is an absolutely wonderful place to stay. Previous to this we stayed in Hout Bay and Camps Bay. We spent the last few days of our trip in The Loft  which is just off Kloof Street. Great location to go out and explore  not far from Long Street etc. Would highly recommend and would happily return  but next time for longer
911211,23223203,2014-11-25,4083723,Mairi,Doreen  her family and her staff were fabulous hosts and their property with all the fab little places to stay is a beautiful  homely refuge in a great part of town. The loft is wonderful design  a pleasure to stay there.
911211,25163030,2015-01-08,2460218,Jolle,Hello everyone Hooray  you definitely found the right spot to stay in Cape Town. So stop searching and just book one of the beautiful rooms of Doreen  yes there are more room options. We stayed in the Loft  which is a beautiful light appartement  bright and modern decorated with an etnic touch  a nice  kitchen and a splendid Table mountain view roof terras. Every day you find yourself a clean room again. The pool in the garden is perfect for a relaxed afternoon swim. For the design interest people  the main house is very inspiring and you find a very nice wall painting in the garden too. It's just around the corner of Kloof Street nice hip shops and restaurants on walk distance. Situated very central in between city and the beach Just perfect with lovely nice people welcoming  helping you... you never want to leave again  and that is not exaggerated  
911211,25995024,2015-02-01,9625934,Anna,Doreen and her family were the best host you can ever think of I had such an amazing time The house was exactly my style  and felt very at home. It was very clean  everyday the cleaning lady dropped by  that was so nice. Next time I'm definitely going to stay here again
611956,2885879,2012-11-15,3702989,Martin,Great location and very nice apartment with nice furnishings and views. We had a great time. Daryl and Ron are helpful and fun hosts. We stayed there with a baby and they even rented a baby cot. They were very sweet with the baby and helpful to the parents with luggage carrying and recommendations as to restaurants  sights etc.
911211,26854593,2015-02-21,2986028,Hilke,Everthing has already been said. It is a wonderful place perfectly located and with a great view. Everyone is very welcoming. It is all clean and you find everything you need - otherwise just asked for it. My sister and I very much enjoyed our stay. Be sure you will love it too.
911211,28352123,2015-03-22,10888369,Ivan,The location is super central  beautiful design and excellent hosts. To sum up Everything was perfect and better than expected.  I'll definitely come back 
911211,31733942,2015-05-09,2369051,Colette,The place is lovely  and especially the view from the cute little terrace is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. A very nice extra we discovered is the heated blanket in bed  The area is vibrant and felt safe highly recommended.
911211,33010213,2015-05-24,1509671,Sarah,We could not have wished for better The loft is gorgeous  perfectly located  well-managed by friendly and warm people Two thumbs up  we will definitely be back.
911211,35713192,2015-06-21,3040870,Kelly,It was an amazing experience staying here in this stylish loft. We didn't manage to use the terrace as there was a problem with the door  but we still managed to enjoy the Loft and its view. Doreen  Robert and Jade were warm and welcoming  and made our short stay absolutely memorable. Location was spot on too But the best thing about staying here was the warmth and joy surrounding this loft. We felt like part of the family Thank you
911211,55621381,2015-12-03,48183499,Susanna,Doreen is a wonderful host and the Garden Cottage is wonderful and of a very high standard. The location is perfect  particularly if you want to explore both the city  Camps Bay and Table Mountain. Doreen's team are also extremely welcoming  helpful and friendly. We would definitely return.
911211,56211679,2015-12-10,46984869,Ingela,Min vistelse hos Doreen var fantastiskt bra. Jag blev generst och vnligt mottagen och fick det bsta omhndertagandet under hela vistelsen. The Loft ligger s vackert med utsikt ver Taffelberget och var mycket smakfullt inrett. Omrdet kndes tryggt och det r enkelt promenera till trevliga restauranger  museer  shopping mm. Jag uppskattade kombinationen att i lugn o ro kunna skriva p loftet och  i pauser vistas i trdgrden och kring poolen. Jag kan varmt rekommendera detta boende i Kapstaden.
911211,58493236,2016-01-03,38554317,Matt,Fantastic room and lovely reception from the hosts on site. Couldn't really want any more
911211,65500900,2016-03-15,51205529,Matthias,It was our fourth time in Capetown Bue due to the hospitality of Doreen's family and our wonderful loft for sure the best time ever We will come back for sure
911211,602537559,2020-02-07,13539681,Alice,Booked a room  we were then contacted saying it was fully booked. Did not stay
911211,1050587981272797147,2023-12-20,448782467,Piers,Had an awesome time at Doreens place Loft was beautiful with amazing views of Table Mountain. Everything was clean and all admin was easy. Couldnt have been in a better location in Cape Town too
611956,3744920,2013-03-11,4668393,Petra,A beautyful location and really good hosts. We really enjoyed our stay.
611956,5620610,2013-07-08,2662028,Tim,We loved staying at 15 on Graham. The apartment was huge-more than big enough for the two of us. Great location close to community shops  restaurants and cafes. Close enough to the VA Waterfront to walk in while spotting whales spouting. Great to have front and back terraces to maximize winter sun outside. Our hosts were very welcoming and gave us plenty of good advice. Flatteur for breakfast and La Boheme for dinner are essentials. The bed was amazingly comfortable and our whole experience was outstanding. Definitely recommended  even in winter
611956,6249441,2013-08-05,1364896,Carsten,We had really a great time at Darryl's and Ron's flat. It's a nice and quiet flat with a lot of space. Sea Point is a good place  safe and close to Waterfront or the innercircle. I already knew it from my last time in Cape Town. And Darryl and Ron are wonderful hosts. Hope we can stay there again soon.
611956,6874137,2013-08-28,4560911,EbruChristian,We enjoyed our stay a lot  and felt very safe. The apartment is in Sea Point which is a perfect location. The apartment offers a lot of space and a great kitchen. The hosts were very helpful and lovely. Highly recommended Hope to stay here again on our next trip to Cape Town.
611956,6949267,2013-08-31,10366819,Pablo,The apartment is really nice and spacious  only a block from the promenade in Seapoint  and Ron and Darryl were superb hosts. They made themselves available for anything i could help and left me some complimentary milk coffee  etc for breakfast. Parking is in a private open parking nearby the house  which is much better than in the street. A very nice stay in a very nice place in a very nice city even with bad weather. I will definitively repeat.
611956,8596860,2013-11-07,1364896,Carsten,It was our second time at Darryl's and Ron's flat and we enjoyed again staying at the apartment. We can't wait to go back. Darryl and Ron  please keep up your good work. Finally  you're really great and lovely hosts and we wish you all the best. See you soon.
611956,8979654,2013-11-30,9245699,Julia,My sister and I came to Cape Town for our first visit from the U.S. and loved the city  the apartment and our hosts Ron and Darryl  The apartment is roomy  beautifully decorated  and conveniently located to everything in Cape Town.  Our only regret is that we only had 2 nights to spend there.  Ron and Darryl live right downstairs  making it very easy to get the keys upon arrival and suggestions from true neighborhood locals about restaurants  where to shop  etc.     We definitely recommend this apartment to anyone coming to Cape Town who is looking for a 2 bedroom  2 bathroom gem.
611956,9732067,2014-01-07,7287196,Sheryl,Ron and Darryl were wonderful They both made us feel so welcome and were so helpful. Just incredibly  incredibly nice. The apartment was very comfortable  clean and could not have been better for us. We had a fantastic time. We would definite return there again.
930318,227791563,2018-01-16,34760561,Quintin,Blue Views was amazing. The 2 bedroom penthouse has amazing views  very spacious and the service from the staff is truely 5 star.
930318,232917173,2018-02-07,96524845,Karin,Der Blick von der Terrasse ist spitze. Das Appartement ist auf den ersten Blick eine Augenweide. Was uns etwas enttuscht hat  war das wir vom Bett aus keinen Meerblick hatten. Damit war jetzt auch nicht explizit geworben  aber bei der Lage durchaus mglich. Die bauliche Substanz hat mich an Huser in Amerika denken lassen. Bei genauerer Betrachtung naja. Aber wir wollten ja nur ein paar Tage schillen. Fr uns war Camp Bay letztlich nicht der richtige Ort. Zu viel Trubel  zu viel Verkehr  die Nachbarn sehr nah  weil alles sehr vollgebaut ist.
930318,452548784,2019-05-13,238212626,Emeka,Lovely view
930318,455752045,2019-05-20,104804429,Tito,Awesome penthouse with great views. The hosts are also attentive

930476,161532850,2017-06-18,130290950,Terry,Very spacious  clean and neat. Perfect for a big family's time away.
611956,10953533,2014-03-15,3346421,Kristina,The place is in a great neighborhood and close to the ocean front. Stylish furnished and perfectly looked after  as well as spotlessly clean. Ron is super helpful and explains very patiently what you need or want to know  whether at time of booking or whenever there are questions before arrival and as well during the stay. There is lots of space for 4 people and it's definitely a thumbs up for a Cape Town visit.
611956,11147555,2014-03-23,10917864,William Mickey,I really can't add to perfection Everything about DR place was absolutely perfect.  This includes the graciousness of our Hosts.
611956,11424834,2014-04-02,7480747,Loris,Beautiful apartment in perfect location allowing you to walk to dinner or down to the seafront.  Finished to a high standard.  Hosts were super friendly and helpful.  As we had small child it was well laid out and we were able to allow him run freely.  We would definitely recommend to friends
611956,12205430,2014-04-26,12271271,Kathy,Thank you Ron for being such a friendly host - the apartment is fabulous - big spacious and clean  its a great spot close to the city - so it was perfect for our needs.
611956,12950733,2014-05-15,402071,Melania,Ron and Darryl were the perfect hosts  giving us a list of restaurants in their neighborhood  helping us plan our tour of the wine country.  Their apartment was comfortable clean  and spacious...and only a block from the scenic beach walk
611956,18146537,2014-08-22,12767104,Kerri,Wonderful flat in great location and super welcoming hosts. The flat is located between Main and Beach Road  giving you easy access to both the Promenade and the restaurants and cafes of Main Street but also really quiet and secure. There are My Citi bus stops to the Waterfront and the City Centre within a few minutes walk.It is a beautifully presented and restored space  really spacious rooms with two terraces. The beds are really comfortable Darryl and Ron have thought through everything guests might need and are on hand to welcome you and provide any tips or advice you might need. They provide coffeeteamilk and juice which is really appreciated. Even though it was pouring with rain in Cape Town we had a lovely time  largely due to the comfort and convenient position of the flat and the attentiveness of our hosts. Would highly recommend.
611956,18397178,2014-08-26,10442682,Chunghao,Ron and Darryl have a wonderful place.  They were very accommodating and made sure they met us during the stay.  The place is nicely furnished and close to the ocean.  There are good restaurants and shops within close walking distance.   I would recommend this place if you are staying in Cape Town.
611956,18704265,2014-08-31,12995875,Sven,I stayed for 5 days in Ron and Darryls beautiful colonial style apartment. It is in a very quite neighbourhood close to the beach. A lot of restaurants  supermarkets and shops are within walking distance. Ron and Darryl really made our stay awesome. They are friendly and helpful hosts who provided all we need and even more. I can explicitly recommend to stay with these guys. You wont regret it Whenever I am coming back to capetown I am looking forward join them again.
611956,19309080,2014-09-10,11602193,Gladys,We were made to feel most welcome on our arrival with supplies of coffee  tea  milk and cookies. The apartment  was ideally located  minutes from great restaurants  water front and hop-on-hop-off bus.  The accommodation was very spacious  clean and exceeded our expectations. We had a wonderful view of Lion's Head and para gliders from our large back balcony. Darryl  and Ron were amazing hosts  helpful  good humoured and just plain fun
611956,19871901,2014-09-20,8238720,Merel,Het is een geweldig mooi en luxe appartement en de slaapkamers doen niet onder voor een hotel Het appartement is ruim en smaakvol ingericht zodat je je er snel thuis voelt. Bij mooi weer heb je de beschikking over twee prachtige balkos. Darryl en Ron zijn heel aardig en geven graag informatie en tips over Kaapstad. Locatie in Seapoint ook heel centraal ten opzichte van alle bezienswaardigheden. Zeker een adres om terug te komen
611956,20595048,2014-10-02,11174773,Angela,Lovely accomodation in a great neighbourhood. The suite was exactly as described and Ron made us feel right at home. We arrived very jet lagged and were grateful that we were able to check in early. We definitely plan to stay here again on our next visit to Cape Town.
611956,20875941,2014-10-06,19202633,Stefan,I think the best way to describe this place is that it is somewhere that I would be happy living.  and I think that is saying a lot.  beautiful apartment with wonderful hosts.  by far my favorite Airbnb and will never spend another night in a hotel in Mother City.  Perfect location also...
611956,21866612,2014-10-26,14293671,Janell,Ron and Darryl are the most gracious hosts  The apartment is wonderful and very much a home away from home.  We loved the location and the restaurants in the area.
611956,22517537,2014-11-09,6404438,Pall,What a great place to stay in. Everything one needs  spacious  clean and like someone else said it's somewhere I'd like to live myself Great neighbourhood  lovely restaurants and a morning jog by the very nearby seaside is a perfect start to the day. Very welcoming and friendly hosts  would definitely stay here again next time in Cape Town there will be a next time  the city is just plain awesome.
611956,22831221,2014-11-16,21545627,Helen,Perfect This place is if anything nicer and even more spacious than the pictures make out. It was spotlessly clean  well equipped  very comfortable and just the perfect place to stay. The hosts  Daryl and Ron live in the apartment underneath and were very welcoming and friendly while also giving us our privacy. Highly recommended
611956,26520103,2015-02-15,4463379,Katy,We were thrilled with our stay at Darryl and Ron's.  The location was terrific within SeaPoint. It is one block from the sea and one block from the main road with all the shops  so it couldn't be more convenient. The apartment was immaculate and stylish and extremely spacious.  Both bedrooms are very generously sized and ensuite and the second bedroom has a small entry way with doors on either side  which was the perfect place to put our baby's cot so that she could be nearby but closed off from light and noise while she was sleeping  and it allowed us the utilize both bedrooms.  The living area and kitchen are huge and the whole apartment is light and bright with gorgeous outdoor space. Darryl and Ron were excellent hosts and always available to help out.
930476,201435963,2017-10-08,5545739,Alice,Amazing place  great location  extremely responsive and flexible team. We had an incredible time
930476,231656095,2018-02-02,48748991,Jonas Benjamin,it was a very nice trip  we would recommend this location again
930476,321779841,2018-09-11,163335072,Eduardo,great place and location. perfecto conditions apartment. better than I expected
930476,327765886,2018-09-24,70888969,Warwick,As far as AirBnB's go  this is a winner. 7 bedrooms en-suite plus a guest WC and then every amenity you could think of for a fabulous group or family holiday. A real winner
930476,457509900,2019-05-24,66510156,Danielle,This was an amazing AirBnB. I travel a lot and this is by far one of the best places I have stayed. It was not far from the beach and other attractions. Also  the view was AMAZING
611956,27459269,2015-03-05,16802891,Cleve,Ron warmly welcomed us  he was flexible about us dropping our stuff early.  We have 2 young kids  and Ron was engaging and welcoming of them too - despite his beautifully finished spot.  The listing was very accurate  and if anything  doesn't do justice to what a lovely apartment it is.  It is spotlessly clean  tastefully furnished and decorated  very spacious  and has front balcony and a back sitting area - so lots of outdoor areas to enjoy the Cape's beauty. The beds and linen are top notch too. They provided a garage for our rental car  which was an unexpected bonus. Yet we didn't even need our car - their spot is right next to countless excellent restaurants  2 good supermarkets  and THE BEACH.  We rented bikes  and cycled to the Waterfront on safe cycle paths right next to the ocean. We chose Seapoint for our Cape Town stay because it is so central - and if you do want to go anywhere - you're always going in the opposite direction to all the traffic.   A winning spot Can't wait to go back.
611956,27986887,2015-03-16,4673886,Lianne,This place was perfect First  the location is amazing. You are close enough to walk to restaurants  grocery stores  while being only 2 blocks from the beach. AND it was quiet at night. The hop on-hop off bus is a short walk away. Really loved the neighbourhood. Second  the apartment is beautiful. Exactly as pictured if not better. So spacious - a true two big bedrooms that are really nicely furnished  great linens. We felt at home as soon as we walked in. The big terrace is a great bonus. Everything we needed was in this place. Third  the hosts are the nicest guys you could imagine. They were accommodating  helpful and present if needed. Highly  highly recommend. We hope to come back to stay here again.
611956,28978436,2015-04-02,14691271,Catherine,We absolutely loved it Our hosts Darryl  Ron were there on arrival  friendly and answered our many questions. The accommodation is well laid out  beautifully decorated and clean. Great location and parking. Should we ever come back to Capetown  we would be staying there again
611956,29378805,2015-04-07,23722704,Chris,I'm loath to write this review because I don't want to share Darryl  Ron's apartment with anyone else Yes  it was that good spacious  super-comfortable  brilliantly located  a huge terrace  two en-suite bathrooms...the list just goes on. Darryl  Ron themselves were welcoming  courteous and very thoughtful  also helping us when we had to book an unexpected extra day. We will definitely be back.
611956,30904975,2015-04-28,31459740,Dylan,Everything was looked exactly like the pictures   no....actually it was even better than that. We loved every minute of it. It is very neat and spacious. Very modern and well looked after. Ron and Darryl are great hosts   showed us everything we needed to know and more. We needed a weekend away to just relax   and this was the perfect place. I am so glad this was the place we decided on after looking at so many places. Will most definitely go back....
611956,42128880,2015-08-11,33966588,Eliezer,Darryl and Ron's apartment is absolutely beautiful  in a perfect location. Staying there was one of the highlights of our vacation and we can highly recommend it. It is fully equipped  spacious  and beautifully furnished and decorated. And Darryl and Ron were wonderful hosts - friendly  welcoming and always ready to help. And if you are a kosher traveller  this apartment is perfect - kosher food and a great synagogue are nearby  and youre inside the eruv.
611956,43536960,2015-08-20,7059559,Lauren,We had a fantastic stay in Darryl and Ron's apartment. The location was perfect too and restaurants nearby were great. The apartment really is lovely.
930476,596266510,2020-01-22,61468475,Elisabet,Phantastic Panoramic view  highly luxurious  great comfort
930476,608576629,2020-02-21,248188158,Lena,Thanks Kerri and Kelly for being such an amazing host. We loved staying at your villa and enjoyed every bit of it. This was not only due to the place which is super luxury and beautiful but also to you  as you were amazing hosts. Also the fact that we could leave our luggage in your hotel down the road and even shower before we got on the plane  made this experience complete. Thanks

930482,266574166,2018-05-20,189694085,Brigitte,I came across this property by pure chance  and WOW what a pleasant surprise...  It has 4 very spacious bedrooms all en suite so we all could enjoy our own private space. The property is modern and very well maintained. You literary just cross the road and walk 100 meters to the most beautiful secluded beaches. The main Camps Bay beach is also just 10 minutes walk away. The housekeeping team was very friendly and efficient and the manager who checked us in even helped us book some day trips and restaurants which I found very convenient. I highly recommend this place...
611956,46145815,2015-09-08,26472373,Ryan,Ron and Darryl were incredible  so gracious  accommodating and helpful in making our trip to Cape Town wonderful. My biggest regret is not being able to stay at their house longer. The two full bedrooms and bathrooms were perfect for our group  lovely furnishing  the balconies are terrific and the house is in a great location. Moreover  it just was really comfortable and we always felt like we were home there. Looking forward to coming back and staying here again soon
611956,47711904,2015-09-21,5820627,Ockert,I am not going to repeat what everyone else have said in the reviews save to say that all the positive feedback about the apartment and the hosts is thoroughly deserved. Book this wonderful  airy  light and well situated place if you can still find an opening on the calendar - you will not regret it Thank you Darryl and Ron for being such amazing hosts and for a wonderful stay. I will be back
611956,48377522,2015-09-26,2797679,Joyce,Wonderful place to stay in Cape Town  The flat is spacious and beautiful -- even better than the photos.  It's in a safe neighborhood a block from the ocean promenade  a block from stores and restaurants  and two blocks from the hop-onhop off and city bus stop.  The kitchen came stocked with  breakfast items as well as lots of books and pamplets on the area.  Ron and Darryl are the perfect hosts  always there when you need them but not intrusive.  The best Airbnb experience I've had.
611956,49309439,2015-10-03,19506234,Bruce,We felt more than welcome from the moment we picked up the keys from Darryl and Fudge and Oscar.  The apartment was gorgeous  well appointed  and completely equipped.  Darryl and Ron were lovely hosts...they were available and helpful  but not in our faces.  We would not hesitate to stay with Ron and Darryl again.
611956,51605205,2015-10-22,34876369,Nicole,We had a very late flight in and Darryl was kind enough to stay awake to greet us with some treats in the fridge to get us started. This was a great and welcoming touch to the start of our journey. The space was beautiful to say the least. It was much larger than the pictures suggested. We had an amazing time and even better views. I want to get back to Cape Town just to stay here again
611956,52508381,2015-10-30,176108,Toa,Darryl was an amazing host. After our flight from Jo'burg was delayed  he stayed up to the wee hours of the night to greet us and gave us a tour of the place and surrounding area. Everything about this place is amazing and far exceed our expectations. It's spacious and located in a safe neighborhood that's surrounding by many great eateries. Not to mention it's literally a few blocks away from the Promenade.
611956,53040515,2015-11-04,30848058,Myriam,Ron and Darryl were charming hosts and suggested restaurants as well as places to visits during our stay.  The property is old and beautifully decorated and maintained.  We loved the balcony and terrace which provide some great additional space.  The location is near restaurants and sea front and sits only a few minutes drive from Cape Town Water Front and Clifton beaches Cape Town exclusive residential.

The apartment is perfect and is brilliantly located. it is well looked after and clean and comfortable.

930482,416139350,2019-02-24,70498528,Jade,The place was fantastic. Our only regret was that we didnt get to spend more time in the house as we were so busy It was beautiful and just what we needed. We had no issues whatsoever
930482,419029207,2019-03-03,31128977,David,Fabulous house in a great location. Place was very clean and staff were super accommodating and easy to deal with. Check-inout was a breeze. Only shortcoming was kitchen wasn't amazingly appointed for more serious cooks. We did get by though and it was so nice to be able to enjoy the house  dining in one of the nights. Would stay again anytime
930488,209866882,2017-11-06,128733633,Wijnand,Spend a weekend here with friends. There are 7 very spacious bedrooms  all with their own en-suite bathrooms. Great housekeeping service. The property was beautifully and conveniently located at the Bakoven beaches. A short walk away from Camps Bay  where we had a lovely dinner. Would highly recommend this house  as everything you could have imagined was catered for. Even wood was provided for the BBQ and fireplace. Very happy to have found this place and would love to return on our next holiday to Cape Town. In one word Amazing

611956,70554156,2016-04-18,48937668,Sarah,Amazing place and super friendly hosts. They both came up to welcome us and make sure we were settled. We had a couple very minor issues arise and they responded to and then took care of them within an hour. Great location  close to the ocean  but a few blocks off so it's nice and quiet. Some basics were left in the kitchen sugar  tea  milk which is awesome coming off of a 24 hour travel day. Great place for two couples traveling together as both rooms are just about equivalent. Comfy beds - felt like a home. We would stay here again without question.
611956,71909779,2016-04-29,46314693,Jennifer,Darryl and Ron's apartment is just fantastic. Beautifully furnished  stylish  well equipped  comfortable and in a great location minutes from the sea.

All in all  a fantastic experience and one we would definitely repeat. Thanks guys

Lovely outdoor veranda to enjoy the weather outside too.  Sea point is such a convenient area to stay--with many shops  restaurants  and attractions within walking distance.  Everything else is an easy uber ride away.  I can't say enough how wonderful Darryl and Ron are as hosts.  They are so kind  welcoming  and helpful.  My family was here for my wedding and they couldn't have been more accommodating to them.  They checked in on us multiple times and were so friendly  I would highly recommend staying here to anyone and if my family comes back  they will definitely be booking again with Darryl and Ron
611956,78139867,2016-06-05,36692934,Anthony,Our experience can be described in 5 words We didn't want to leave The apartment is just perfect.

611956,124081816,2017-01-01,5820627,Ockert,This is our third stay in this wonderful apartment. We were lucky enough to rent it over the busy Christmas and New Year period and had a wonderful time as always. The apartment is beautifully and tastefully decorated and the location is perfect - walking distance to great restaurants and the Sea Point promenade. We even walked to the Waterfront along the promenade - stopping for lunch and ice cream along the way. Darryl and Ron deserve the super hosts-title. They are very welcoming always providing a bottle of bubbly and a well-stocked kitchen upon arrival and communication with them is very easy. If you are lucky enough to find the apartment unreserved  rent it immediately. You will not regret it
611956,125535029,2017-01-06,1879277,Anders,A very charming place  clean and right in the middle of everything. We love Sea Point and we can strongly recommend this apartment for your stay in CT

611956,132735567,2017-02-19,25087160,David,Not my first time here and not my last - already booked for NovemberDecember.

It really felt like a home away from home. The location is superb  a stones throw away from the Sea Point promenade  shops and restaurants. We cannot wait to return Thanks guys
611956,216997137,2017-12-07,25087160,David,This is not the first time I have stayed here - and this trip  I stayed for 4 weeks. Perhaps that says it all In case it doesn't  Darryl and Ron are charming  utterly helpful hosts. The apartment is spacious  perfect for sharers with two equal doubles  each with their own bathroom. the outside space is super - a glorious sun-drenched terrace. It is spot on and bang in the middle of one of Cape Town's best locations.  I hope I will be back.

611956,221120434,2017-12-25,101243061,Joane,A perfectly lovely find as our base in Cape Town for a destination wedding.  It was central  quiet  private  close to amenities and transport and luxuriously comfortable.  Thank you Darryl and Ron.

It is close to shops and restauranrs in a safe area. It was easy to get to all the sights of Cape town from there. We were a family of 4 with two boys aged 6 and 8 and they loved it too.

930488,439616777,2019-04-19,3477409,Anita,13 of us stayed at Blue Views as we were attending a wedding in Cape Town. The place was amazing and everyone who stayed loved it. It was big enough for our party and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. I found it was almost like staying at the hotel with the additional services they offer e.g. arranging transport for us to the wedding and delivery some drinks to the house upon request. These types of things saved me additional stress. I cant recommend this place enough. I would definitely stay here again should I return to Cape Town.
930488,511280566,2019-08-17,48135076,Yao,Its very nice place
930488,564572114,2019-11-16,35641482,Mansour,Nice big and clean house.  However   windows sound insulation wasn't good. Our stay coincided with a windy weather that made very noisy at night.

611956,535393235,2019-09-24,78564114,Anita,You will not be disappointed if you stay at this charming apartment... The tall ceilings  and ample spaces make you feel like you are in a home  not an upstairs apartment  We loved our time  have already sent the link to two other people  and will definitely be back if our travels bring us to Cape Town again
611956,558663211,2019-11-03,143539583,Kim,Darryl and Rons place exceeded our expectations  It is spacious  sparkling and stylish.  it was very central  easily accessible  safe and secure.

617238,6830198,2013-08-26,1325603,Pete,Great place to stay   compact  clean  great building  everything you need in CT  ill be back 
617238,8193455,2013-10-20,5915638,Julie,Jenny was an absolute pleasure to deal with  Her home is lovely  Such a great location  very modern and clean  beautiful patio  comfortable bed  awesome shower  and great speakers for the ipod dock  My husband and I stayed there for one week and were very satisfied  I would definitely recommend Jenny's place 
617238,11924334,2014-04-19,4764398,Rolando,Jenny has a great apartment in a superb location convenient to anywhere you want to get to. The space is clean and everything works perfectly. Jenny was very proactive about informing us of every detail you could think of and offered a ton of great suggestions about what to do and where to eat in Cape Town. Highly recommend to other travelers
617238,14741009,2014-06-25,11045653,Ryan,Jenny's apartment was fantastic. Perfect size for a couple. We even fell asleep one night out on the little bed on the patio Great location  close to lots of shops and restaurants and the Cape Quarter and about a mile walk to the V  A waterfront. The patio faces a street that has a bar on it so it can get a bit noisy at night on the weekends to people that want peace and quiet perhaps.. The Rockwell is a gorgeous establishment with wonderful service from everyone. When we go back to Cape Town we will definitely stay here again. Thank you Jenny for providing a lovely post for our vacation
617238,15034652,2014-07-01,2188730,Thomas,Cape Town  what a surprise And Jenny is the best host we have had through Airbnb. Her place is well managed  safe and very comfortable. It sits in prime location near Bo Kaap  VA Waterfront and De Waterkant. It was Jenny's guides to Cape Town that effectively became our bible as we crossed each suggestion off over the course of five days. So many amazing tips and insights into local life that we were able to get into the rhythm of things almost immediately. We can't recommend this property highly enough and Cape Town as a holiday destination. Thanks Jenny
617238,18647940,2014-08-30,2686694,Boris,I went to CT to attend a conference. I stayed at Jenny's place for a week. The place is fantastic  very well located and reasonable priced. It is very central  so many cafes and restaurants are walking distance. Also  the facilities at the place are great  and super clean. Jenny was also very helpful from the beginning. Upon arrival  Jenny gives a set of instructions which are very clear to start using the facilities straight away  so you don't waste figuring out things. I really liked this place  and if I ever come back to CT  I will book it again.
933618,5432937,2013-06-30,2250668,David,I can't recommend this place highly enough. It's a beautiful property with stunning views  it's well located  the hosts are lovely and it's great value for money.
933618,7065153,2013-09-05,4556324,Caryn,Jono and Colin are warm  friendly hosts who made us feel very welcome  answered any questions  and they are very interesting people and great fun The photos are lovely  but simply do not do the apartment and view justice.  This spacious apartment has all the amenities to cook  washerdryer  great spa rain shower  comfy bed  fireplace  a large TV  and use of the infinity pool and deck.  The space is quite comfortable for 2 people  conveniently located to Cape Town  with easy access to Camps Bay Promenade and beaches on foot or by car.  There are breathtaking views of Camps Bay  Lions Head  and the Twelve Apostles and we enjoyed gorgeous sunsets overlooking the bay  lovely pool and garden. We highly recommend our hosts and their apartment to everyone and would love to stay with them again on our next visit to Cape Town.   A wonderful couple --we miss them already and only wish we could have stayed longer.  Cheers to you Colin and Jono for the wonderful hospitality and sharing your beautiful home with us
933618,7847456,2013-10-06,5637072,Karen,Perfect bolt hole with gorgeous views and close proximity to camps bay beaches. Hosts were wonderful and welcoming. No wifi but perfect excuse to really relax and put away the crack berry. Will stay here on next trip to CT.
933618,8129290,2013-10-17,965668,Christian,What can we say......SPECTACULAR We were warmly welcomed and felt immediately at home. We had a secure space in their garage and the place was even better than in the pictures The view is just awesome - overlooking Camps Bay with a private pool. The apartment is really spacious  super clean with well appointed finishing touches. Jono and Colin even had some welcome amenities prepared for us - this is true 5 star service Kitchen is fully equipped and the massage shower room helped us to wake up in the mornings. It is also very conveniently located with around 15 minutes to VA Waterfront or 8 minutes to Table Mountain cable car. If we make it back to CT in the future we will definitely stay with Jono and Colin Way to go
933618,8401530,2013-10-29,4858695,Lyn,This property is outstanding and I cannot recommend it highly enough. From the very helpful information by email pre-arrival to the genuine hospitality  not to mention the views to die for.
933618,8635432,2013-11-10,2896093,Elisabeth,The flat is great. It's the perfect place to stay  to watch the sunsets and relax by the pool. Jono and Colin were very welcoming and excellent host.

933618,10190323,2014-02-05,5859158,Stephen,Wonderful stay at Primaview. Jono and Colin are friendly  helpful and lovely guys. The private pool was a great pleasure  as is the really spectacular view. I spent far more time lazing around the property than I would normally do. The studio apartment is very clean  well maintained and has everything you need to enjoy yourself. Very quiet  private. I have stayed in a number of apartments in Camps Bay over the years. I've already rebooked Primaview in 2015. That tells you all you need to know
617238,44334394,2015-08-25,16213308,Marian,Jenny shared a lot of tips and advice with me before I arrived  and the apartment was spotless and very comfortable. It was the perfect base for me for a few days on business and to enjoy a long weekend  and I cannot emphasise enough how convenient the location was. Having a space to yourself inside a hotel building and so close to restaurants and the VA waterfront was the best of both worlds. Recommended
617238,57017970,2015-12-21,46357732,Ryan,What a lovely apartment. Perfectly located with coffee shops all around us. Even with a 10 month old baby it was great  he was able to explore the flat without any hazards. Couldn't recommend this place any more highly

It was great to have the use of the hotel facilities the gym  the pool and the restaurants as well as the privacy of one's own place. The location was perfect with plenty of interesting restaurants and cafes close by.  Jenny provided excellent tips before my trip and communicated with me regularly throughout my stay.

617238,335380207,2018-10-12,6235212,Simone,Jennys apartment is beautiful with a lot of natural light in the living room. Jenny was very responsive and the property management company she uses was extremely punctual in check in and check out. Great location with an easy walk to the waterfront. The only thing to know is that the bedroom doesnt have any natural light but instead looks out into the interior of the building. This didnt bother us as we kept the blackout curtains closed the whole time and were hardly in the bedroom as there is so much to do in Capr Town.
617238,339822471,2018-10-22,109095055,Martijn,Great place  good location  very safe with parking garage and hotel facilities. The apartment was clean  exactly what we needed  great service and a very good host

933618,10331419,2014-02-14,5958601,Rohan,A huge Thank you to Jono  Rob for letting us stay in there wonderful apartment. As with all the other reviews it is even better than the pictures. All the amenities you will need are within the flat so you could just spend the whole time enjoying the pool and spectacular views if that is what you like. Or for the more adventurous  why not try the paragliding off Signal Hill or Shark diving down the coast. With many restaurants in Camps Bay you can also dine out for a reasonable price. This is the second time we have been to Cape Town and we would definitely choose Camps Bay over the city any day. Jono is full of local knowledge so if you are looking for any recommendations he will always point you in the right direction.
933618,11945311,2014-04-20,2975095,Angelika,I really wish to keep that place a secret Jono and Colin are lovely hosts  the appartement is amazing and the view awsome The best place to stay in Capetown. We will be back Thanks so much
933618,16086825,2014-07-22,4633718,Karen,Primaview is gorgeous The view of the ocean is stunning and you have private access to your own flat  the pool and and an outside patio area with lounge chairs and a beautiful garden. In the eve  guinea fowl come to visit It is tastefully decorated  with lots of light and an incredibly comfortable real bed. The kitchen has everything you need and we were happy to be able to do our laundry. Jono and Colin are fabulous hosts  providing a nice welcome bottle of bubbly  water  milk  chocolates  and offering incredibly helpful with tips about taxis and things to do in town. They are also just really nice people The MyCiTi buses are a short walk away  so it is easy to get downtown. We chose this place because of the reviews  and were not disappointed. We wish we had stayed longer We'll be back the next time we are in Cape Town.
933618,16678189,2014-07-31,3300272,Everton,Jono and Colin were wonderful hosts. We had na amazing experience in South Africa and Cape Town felt even more delighful with the warm welcome at Prima View. The flat is gorgeous  well organized with a spectacular view.

636290,18034291,2014-08-20,17464247,Andrew,A great little apartment brilliantly situated within walking distance of the VA Waterfront. Picking up and dropping off the keys was simple and the apartment was secure with a mechanical gate and security guard. It had everything we needed. Only negative was the pillows  in which the stuffing had turned to popcorn.
933618,17682804,2014-08-16,5966372,LauraNel,I can't sing enough praises for this tiny piece of paradise in Camps Bay.  Jono was absolutely lovely and the flat was perfect - exactly as if not better than described.  We'll definitely be coming back
636290,18539595,2014-08-28,13499090,Holly,Great location as it's not far from the waterfront. Easy to access and picking up the keys was fine. Directions supplied to get from the airport to the key collection place weren't very good buy luckily we had a sat nav. Decor of the apartment is a bit shabby and needs to be updated in order to become a stylish loft apartment. It does the job though - clean  good location and has everything you need for a stay in Cape Town.
636290,134807740,2017-03-01,16336222,Camilla,Not worth the price - and we even had a discount. Bad communication. Pool was not accesible half of our stay 1 month. Problems with wifi. Good thing safe. We would choose another place next time.
636290,215676212,2017-12-01,27217202,Larry,Great place in a great location

636290,564562893,2019-11-16,99747880,Amy,The flat is lovely and a great space for 1 person or a couple. The building is safe with 24 hour security. Only a short walk to waterfront. The flat has everything you need. Only downside was the gym and collecting keys.  The gym was very tired and old and not a lot worked. The check in wasn't that smooth due to the full address not being provided sadly but I got there eventually.  Overall a great place and a great . Thanks.
933618,18515164,2014-08-28,11206443,Tom,This is a great apartment  very comfortable  nicely furnished and stunning views.  The hosts were very friendly and helpful  and we had a fun time exploring the Cape Town area.
933618,19508209,2014-09-14,11846284,Gideon,What a fantastic apartment in a fantastic country situated in a breath taking location. What a gem. The guys running the place are nothing short of true gents. They go out of their way to make sure you're making the most of the area with local knowledge of the markets and other placed of interest.
933618,20732643,2014-10-05,12069048,Michael,What a beautiful Place to stay We really enjoyed staying in this awesome Appartment. It is very clean  modern with a lovely Pool  has an amazing view and is perfectly located to discover Cape Town Jono and Colin were responsive to all of our needs and we really appreciated all the help they provided. We definitely would love to stay at the Appartment again when we travel again to Cape Town.
933618,22880309,2014-11-17,3429574,Birgit,It was awesome The appartment is more like a loft  airy  decorated with taste  an eye for details. Apart from many lighting opportunities  we enjoyed the blue lighting of the pool and the illumination of the rock  which is part of the loft. For two people it is really spacious. From the bed and the sofa we had a wonderful view to the ocean through the huge panoramic windows.  We got a very warm welcome  the fridge was stocked with a bottle of bubbly and suisse chocolate.  The kitchen is well equipped with everything to prepare a proper meal. There is also the wonderful view from the window.  Everything was brandnew from soap  toothpath up to cleansing liquids. The terrasse is surrounded by a nice well kept garden. It was always a pleasure to open our own private entrance. We enjoyed the neighbourhood of Jono -  He was a very warm-hearted host.  He was very flexible concerning our arrival and departure time.  We very much felt at home and surely come back again
933618,23091386,2014-11-23,5115218,Kevin,It is great to arrive at a place which is even better than you expected or hoped for Staying at this very well-equipped appartment - with great views on the ocean and with terrific sunsets - plus the warm welcome and care of the two superfriendly hosts  formed a superb end of our holidays. It is very easy to feel at home here  and Jono and Colin did everything to make our stay even better. We recommend this place to everyone and we will definitely check for availability when we would re-visit Cape Town
933618,23578977,2014-12-05,4383642,Mariah,Jono and Colin have been fantastic hosts for us. The house is like heaven on earth with breathtaking views. Waking up with the ocean in front of you will never bore you. The house is very well equipped and very organized and clean. You have a lot of privacy due to your own entrance as well. The house is very spacious for 2 people. It is a true gem in Camps Bay. Thank you soo much Jono and Colin. We hope to see you very soon next year.
933618,24099263,2014-12-20,4625324,Kika,Where do we begin.. We fell in love with this amazing apartment From the location to the interior and the welcoming hosts  we felt really at home here. The ocean view is breathtaking  the house is super clean and equipped with everything you need. We loved coming home after a day at the beach or sightseeing and have a drink at the terrace while watching the sunset. Highly recommended Thank you Jono and Colin
933618,24366352,2014-12-27,10268002,Glynn,We spent a fantastic 4 nights in this wonderful apartment with superb fixtures and fittings and spectacular view. Jono was extremely welcoming and we had no need to ask for anything as all was perfect. Highly recommended and we hope to return again.
933618,24908152,2015-01-04,11679780,Patrick,Exceeded all expectations  this is a perfect place to stay in Capetown. Jono  Colin are extremely welcoming and easy to communicate with perfect hosts. The accommodation has everything you could possibly want and is spotlessly clean. The pool  terrace and gardens are wonderful - we never wanted to leave this oasis. A super place  unreserved recommendation  just stunning. Thank you Jono and Colin. We will be back.
933618,26124709,2015-02-04,5859158,Stephen,This was my second visit and as before  a really lovely stay. The apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures. Hosts Jono  Colin were welcoming and helpful as usual. Everything I needed was at hand and I spent a lovely three weeks lazing by the pool and gazing at the view. One addition since last year was two hammocks - to watch the sun go down with glass of wine in hand. Thank you both for a great holiday.
933618,27194314,2015-02-28,11524450,Brian,Jono was a wonderful accommodating and friendly host. We felt completely 'at home'. The condo was excellently appointed with top of the line appliances and was very comfortable - great TV and internet service too. Also many nice touches  like the welcome wine and chocs  plus some amenities and supplies including coffee and sugar. We have no hesitation in recommending this as it has outstanding views  a lovely pool  and a great location easily accessible to Cape Town and  of course  Camps Bay.
933618,30282980,2015-04-20,26589527,Diana,From the beginning and throughout our visit  Jono made us feel very welcome.  He always made himself available when needed and was helpful and friendly. The apartment was better than we expected  clean  well stocked  comfortable and with one of the most spectacular views.  Close to the main part of Cape Town but peaceful and quiet. We hated to leave such a perfect place.  Amazing sunsets too.  We would highly recommend this accommodation.
933618,31162295,2015-05-03,21437998,Elzbieta,Jono and Colin are perfect hosts Helpful  nice  generous If we ever needed anything - we had it the next day. The place is simply breathtaking - full of light  perfectly clean  amazing view  and a private pool We couldn't wish for anything more 
933618,34618999,2015-06-10,11400808,Mark,Jono and Colin are great hosts. They met us upon arrival and even let us keep our rental car in their garage.  They walked us through the layout of the apartment and took the time to suggest places for us to eat in Camps Bay. This will hard to believe but the apartment is even better than the pictures  complete with kitchen washer  and had easy access to all the goodness of Cape Town and surrounding beaches.  Warm and inviting hosts  beautiful location  we will definitely stay with Jono and Colin when we go back to Cape Town.
933618,35927427,2015-06-23,32107900,Lelann,Our experience was wonderful We couldn't have asked for a more relaxing and comfortable environment to spend our vacation and down time while in Cape Town. Jono and Colin were great hosts who were very welcoming and accommodating. Everything we could have needed was provided plus a little extra. The studio apartment space was pristine and nicely decorated. Not to mention the view of Camps Bay and the ocean skyline was a perfect view almost every day. The sunsets were breathtaking With friendly daily visits from their very sweet cat out on the patio we couldn't have felt more at home. We will definitely be staying here again the next time we visit Cape Town
933618,36670199,2015-06-30,6532146,Stephanie,I had a wonderful experience staying at Primaview in Camps Bay.  The accommodation was excellent  with all modern appliances and comfortable surroundings.  Nothing can beat the view from the patio overlooking Camps Bay photos can't even begin to do it justice perfect setting for a glass of wine and watching the sun set.  The apartment is conveniently located only a 25 minute walk down to Victoria Road along the bay where there are many great bars and restaurants. MyCiti bus route is also right around the corner  with travel time into downtown Cape Town anywhere between 10-20 minutes.  Jono and Colin were extremely accommodating  meeting me upon arrival and giving me a complete overview of the apartment and the surrounding area. I couldn't have asked for better hosts or a better experience in Cape Town.  Wish I could do it all over again
933618,38367991,2015-07-15,16193038,Nikki,The host are beyond amazing. Friendly  informative and left us chocolates  champaign  milk  juice and water. The location views are wonderful. Camps bay is 5 minute drive with restaurants and the beach. Most definitely the best airbnb we have ever stayed at. Thank you
933618,39270437,2015-07-22,10001483,Erica,We had an amazing time at Jono and Colin's. They were fantastic hosts  staying up until 200 a.m. to receive us and getting up early to send us off. There were goodies waiting in the fridge  a heater to keep us warm and a space in the garage to keep our rental car safe. Their home has a spectacular view of Camps Bay and a short drive to grocery stores  cafes and restaurants although their home is so beautiful you'll never want to leave it Thanks again Jono and Colin Erica and Aaron
650049,8436644,2013-10-30,9526362,Patrick,Trs bel appartement  vue splendide  bonne situation  amnagement de qualit il manque seulement la connexion wifi
650049,9430392,2013-12-28,246025,Attapon,Great room  fully equipped apartment  great mountain view  friendly host  fast internet  highly recommended
650049,10492918,2014-02-22,9229790,Helen,The loft has a wonderful view of Bo Kaap and the Table Mountain. It is very comfortable  a lovely large bed and soft pillows and clean. The weather was hot when we were there and we were able to open the doors to allow a breeze through and use the fans during the night  air con not necessary even for us Brits Claire's communication was excellent she is rightly enthusiastic about Cape Town and the surrounding area. Her information folder is detailed and useful  one of the recommended restaurants was a fabulous experience  really special. We had a wonderful stay in every respect  thanks for everything  Claire..
650049,11919623,2014-04-19,12495998,Ana,It was my first time booking a flat with Airbnb  I have never been to Cape Town and took my time to search for an apartment. I wanted to make sure I am in a safe neighbourhood  that there is public transport to get around  that there are nice places to eat and go out and that the flat is functional and stylish. All of those criteria were met by Claires apartment It is amazingly stylish  has everything one needs for comfortable living including iron  hair dryer  dish washer etc . One of the apartments walls is literally a huge window. The view is so phenomenal that one does not want to leave the flat  but merely stay on the balcony and enjoy a glass of South African wine every night while watching the sunset over the Table mountain. The flat is extremely central  to the point I could walk to work and other locations Last but not least  Claire is the most amazing host you could ever get  she gave me a neighbourhood tour as I arrived with plenty of tips  drove me to Cape Point and around  asked whether I was missing smth in the apartment and always cared for everything I might need I could not be happier with my choice and will definitely book this apartment if I were to come back to Cape Town again
933618,41219209,2015-08-05,11930988,Namho,My stay at Jono and Colin's place was simply fantastic They were very kind  friendly  and always available for help. The house was perfectly clean and had every basic item for comfortable stay. plus we were even offered champagne and chocolate It is located within a quiet and safe neighbourhood  few minutes drivewalk from Camps Bay and not far from downtown  with an amazing view of the ocean. A perfect place for laidback holidays. MyCiti bus stops are close to the house but it would be convenient to rent a car  as the bus does not run frequently. I would definitely go back to Primaview when I visit Cape Town again. 
933618,46690279,2015-09-13,16953676,Quincy,I give my experience at Prima View an 11 out of 10. All of our needs were met and then some. Jono and Colin were gracious hosts  leaving wine and chocolates yes please in the fridge as a welcome gift. The apartment was clean and lovely on all accounts. The view was unmatched  and the bus stop outside was so convenient. Can't wait to go back
933618,49305988,2015-10-03,27428786,Cassie,Myself and my partner had an amazing time at Primaview  the apartment was lovely and comfortable and the view was absolutely stunning Thank you so much Jono and Colin you were very helpful and such lovely people. We would definitely come back to Cape Town and would love to stay at Primaview again x
933618,50464690,2015-10-12,794220,Alexander,Jono and Colin are definitely great hosts They are extremely helpful  communicative and welcoming in person. The space is just perfect and amazing  quiet  private  and yet around the corner from all the great things Cape Town has to offer The view is spectacular. The interior is great and everything you need for a comfortable is offered. Definitely  I recommend this space to anyone visiting Cape Town.
933618,51115504,2015-10-18,18448089,Francis,Jono and Colin have the most beautiful home. It is so luxurious and is absolutely perfect in every way The views are more than breath taking with camps bay to the front and table mountain behind The only  dilemma is choosing which way to look when sitting by the pool It is decorated to such a high standard and we can't recommend this listing highly enough
933618,52955190,2015-11-03,4301673,Charnel,I cannot enthuse enough about Prima View and how perfect our time was staying here. Jono and Colin were absolutely fantastic hosts and such genuinely lovely people Jono greeted us as soon as we arrived from the airport and made us feel so welcomed. The pictures really do not reflect how beautiful this place actually is  that view is mesmerizing. The apartment is spacious  clean and tidy and everything you need to make you feel comfortable is provided and you feel like you have your privacy 24hrs a day. I felt so grateful to be there and Jono and Colin really helped make our time in Cape Town feel special and were always there to help us. Can't thank you enough 
933618,56774567,2015-12-18,3429574,Birgit,It was our second stay The loft was impeccable. Jono and Colin were great hosts  helpful as ever They truly walk the extra mile.  The loft is decorated with great taste  towels and linen are of extra quality  changed once a week. In addition the loft was cleaned once a week. We felt at home from the very first minute. It was wonderful to sit under the big umbrella in the afternoon and look over the ocean. We'll certainly come back

650049,23362937,2014-11-30,10771356,Katie,I can't say enough wonderful things about our experience at Claire's apartment. It's every bit as well-decorated  modern  and clean as the pictures suggest  and the view of Table Mountain and Lion's Head is breathtaking. As someone who is not at all familiar with Cape Town  we were continually amazed by how great the location is... So much good coffee and food in the blocks surrounding the apartment  and the walk to the waterfront  Bo Kaap  and Long and Bree Streets are minimal. And a huge plus was the book of recommendations Claire has stationed in the apartment. Claire was so helpful and accommodating  and her apartment provided an absolutely perfect home base for us to explore Cape Town. I would recommend this place to everyone  and if I find myself back I Cape Town  I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.
650049,23815580,2014-12-11,2660582,Randy,Wow  the view from this loft is amazing I am glad that we had the privilege to stay a week at Claire's loft. The place is nice and clean and the location can't be beat. Claire's guide to the area is spot on with fantastic recommendations.  If this is available the next time we are in Cape Town  we will return.
650049,23976743,2014-12-15,4192485,Kevin,Claire's apartment was the perfect place to spend my Cape Town holiday. The parking spot was very convenient and the views were even better than I expected. Claire made sure to keep a well-stocked apartment and even welcomed me with a nice bottle of South African wine
650049,24299135,2014-12-25,7610493,Eva,Claire is a lovely host who wants you to have the best Cape Town experience you could have. The apartment is beautiful in the perfect location in Cape Town's city center. Next time I come to the mother city I would definitely live in that apartment again
650049,27588837,2015-03-08,125740,Ib,I really loved this place I could have stayed forever if I had the time. If its available - BOOK IT
650049,29147252,2015-04-04,6354615,Sean,The Apartment was basically brand new and just as advertised. The service provided by Claire was extremely professional....I arrived late so all arrangements had been made with security who were well organised upon my arrival . Very central location....I would definitely stay again.
650049,29687910,2015-04-11,16338878,Manuel,The apartement was just amazing Everything was as described and even better. Everything was very clean and Claire was a helpful and reliable host  so it was easy to feel welcome and enjoy our stay in Capetown.
650049,32295192,2015-05-16,766230,Benn,We have had many great AirBnB experiences  but this one was by far our favorite. The apartment is so beautiful  modern and very clean. The location and views could not be beat  and the guidebooks were so helpful. We stayed here to start our honeymoon and Claire made us feel so welcome with a complimentary bottle of bubbly to start our celebration We were also very pleased with her quick reservation acceptance and availability to answer questions at all times. This was a remarkable experience  and I would suggest this listing to anyone visiting Cape Town
650049,32823195,2015-05-22,10787356,Nina,This place is awesome It looks brand new Easily walkable to lots of local places  although if you're lazy like me you can use a cab to get around for very little. Claire has a local cell phone she leaves for you in the house which I definitely appreciated. The view of table mountain and the bo kap area is beautiful. Nice  safe area. It is Cape Town so always be mindful of your surroundings. Fast internet  great cable tv  secure building with doormen and fob access. Great price. You'd easily pay more for a hotel room that doesn't come close to being as chic. Thanks Claire
650049,33797435,2015-06-01,6675311,Brandon,Claire was a wonderful host She provided excellent information to help get us to the address to start with  then went the extra mile by meeting us there in person upon arrival to show us around. Not only was the apartment pristine and beautiful  it also had a few tips and tricks she was happy to show us. Claire made lots of great suggestions for places places to eat  drink  and be merry  based on our specific tastes and interests  and she had compiled a comprehensive package of information about the area  too. The cherry on top was a lovely bottle of red wine waiting for us  which we made short work of. In terms of the building  in and out access was easy and very secure  and the actual location is great for walking  public transit  or getting a taxi. Claire is outgoing and friendly-- just a total delight We felt quite welcomed to Cape Town

All extra amenities were present  such as ironing board  detergents  tourism booklets etc. which made for great convenience.  The apartment is in a supreme location with ease of access to all points of interest and restaurants within Cape Town.  Great view on the balcony of the city as well as the mountain.  Security is present as is controlled access to parking.  A bottle of wine upon arrival is always a great touch.  A definite recommend.

Great apartment in a central location.  The views are unbelievable.  The apartment is equipped with everything you would need.  Wine  laundry soap  great linens for bed and bath.  I had no issues at check in even though it was nearly midnight.  The front desk worker helped me with my luggage and was very friendly.  It was nearby to Long Street for shopping  a few restaurants across the street and within walking distance of Victoria  Alfred waterfront.  I would absolutely stay there again and for the price  it was worth every penny
650049,50624135,2015-10-13,3969461,Amanda,Great location and views  comfy accommodations  easy check in and Claire left a ton of information about Cape Town and the apartment in a binder  which was really useful. We appreciated her fast response time to any questions and would recommend anyone to stay in her place. Thanks Claire

A perfect place for laidback Holidays excellent Restaurants  nice pool and amazing sunsets. It was convenient to park our rented car in their Garage.

Die Rumlichkeit ist modern  grozgig und entsprach vllig unserem Geschmack. Der Ausblick auf den Atlantik mit sagenhaften Sonnenuntergngen  und der uns ganz allein zur Verfgung stehende Pool  uneinsehbar  haben dem Ganzen die Krone aufgesetzt  so da wir ungern abgereist sind und sicher wiederkommen werden.
933618,65765154,2016-03-17,26113221,Jane,Ne plus ultra all the way.  Delightful hosts  wonderful accommodation.  Extraordinary view.  We've never had a better holiday.  6 stars.

We loved our weekend at Primaview  so much that we cancelled all our plans on Saturday to rather chill and hang out by the pool and enjoy the sun and the view. Later also the sun set. Jono and Collin were the perfect hosts  so welcomming  helpful and happy. They had left a suprise for us in the fridge bubly wine  chocolates  water  juice and milk for our tea and coffee. The pictures does not show how great the space indoors and outdoors are. Its open  spacious  bright  clean  tidy  and has everything you need to enjoy your stay. We will be back
933618,68091718,2016-04-02,3572688,Lizzie,Jono's place was perfect The apartment had everything we needed and more Really homely and ideal for what we needed only wish we'd had more time to use the pool which looked clean and inviting everyday. The pictures don't do it justice  it's really spacious and has a relaxing decor. Jono was a brilliant host always on hand and provided us with last minute requests of spare keys and umbrellas. He was excellent  we had such a fab stay  highly recommend to others guests.
933618,68869870,2016-04-07,28955121,Lisa,Could not have asked for a better stay the accommodation is stunning  the location is great oh  the views and Jono and Colin are the friendliest hosts you could wish for.

The space itself is incredibly inviting and attractive - it's hard to imagine a better way to stay in Cape Town and in Camps Bay - and with welcome treats in the fridge and absolute privacy I can say that this is among the very best Air BnB experiences I've ever had.

My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights in February. Claire provides a red binder that is filled with apartment information and recommendations for things to do while in town. We took many of her recommendations  and weren't sorry...she has great taste.  The view of Table Mountain  the cleanliness of the flat  comfortable bed  and good wifi  are bonuses to the great location and Claire's spectacular hospitality
650049,65136294,2016-03-11,4073601,Susan,We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Claire's appartment. Communication was excellent at every stage  we felt totally confident that all arrangements had been taken care of. As a fellow traveller she understands what visitors require  goes above  beyond the expected. The location of the appartment was very convenient  the views of Table Mountain  Lion's Head were very special. We had a hire car  underground parking was available- the space is a little tight so a small car is best. Claire's information file was brilliant. As Claire was travelling at the time of our visit we had information about her manager who helped us when we needed some important documents printed. They were even delivered to the door. Many thanks.
650049,68668606,2016-04-06,33121241,Blake,This was a great place to stay. Very convenient  secure  and a room with a view.  I didn't meet Claire  but the 24 hour reception took care of my check in and check out. Very walkable to most points of interest in Cape Town. I picked this listing because it looked like a place I'd want to live if I was Capetonian. Which turned out to be true. Also because it had a great view for sundowners as the sunset between Table Mountain and Lion's Head.
650049,72797229,2016-05-04,31377322,Simon,Claire is an amazing host and her flat is perfect for a Cape Town visit  We were lucky to meet her when we arrived and she was very sweet giving us all kinds of advice on Cape Town.  The flat is super comfortable in a very convenient location to all the CT highlights.  Small details were great such as a drawer full of power converters and adapters which were awesome for my wife's hair gadgets  Thanks very much and we hope to come back soon  From Seattle  Simon and Kristen.
650049,74385218,2016-05-15,23846871,Chelsea,Claire's place was better than a hotel. Should we come back to Cape Town we will definitely stay here again

She has lots of info and recommendations really well organized in a binder that we used to supplement the research we'd done ahead of time. The building felt really secure with a locked garage and a doorman who made check-in really easy.  We were there on the weekend and the area did not have a lot of foot traffic so we didn't walk around very much at night  but it was really centrally located and easy to drive or Uber wherever we wanted to go.
650049,102018752,2016-09-16,26791716,Richard,Claire was helpful and easy to reach. Accessing the apartment was comfortable  security made the apartment safe.

Would 100 stay here again.
650049,108961666,2016-10-18,27579727,Nicole,Claire's place was everything we hoped for and more.  It was comfortable and clean  colorful and in a lively area  and most importantly we felt safe.  Our favorite part about staying at Claire's place was the magnificent binder she has that gives the best Cape Town recommendations - every restaurant that we tried was amazing.  We even tried a club that she recommended and had a blast.  Stay at Claire's place if you can  You won't regret it.
933618,75049520,2016-05-18,2914885,Mary Elizabeth,This is likely the best Airbnb property my husband and I have ever stayed in.

The location is amazing  quite and so romantic. Jono himself is an absolute gent so nice and friendly and always there to give us advice and to answer any question we had. He was in communication with us from the day we booked the appt and right throughout our stay. He gave us advice on what activities were around the location and was super helpful. Really can not say enough about him as a host he really made us feel so welcome there. Thanks so much Jono from Aidan and Ann.
933618,95447578,2016-08-19,9200094,Patrice,Das wunderschne Apartment mit Aussicht auf die Apostels und Camps Bay bertraf unsere Erwartungen. Das Bett war sehr bequem  die Dusche angenehm und das ganze Apartment usserst sauber gehalten. Der Garten und der Swimming Pool rundeten das herausragende Airbnb ab. Der Kontakt mit den Hosts Jono und Colin war sehr angenehm und sie bereiteten uns mit ihrer Gastfreundschaft eine grosse Freude. Dieses Airbnb werde ich gerne weiterempfehlen und bei einem nchsten Aufenthalt in Kapstadt wieder buchen.
933618,103918218,2016-09-24,63311883,Alexandra,Unser Aufenthalt bei Jono und Colin war einfach rundum perfekt Angefangen von der Begrung inklusive mehrerer netter Aufmerksamkeiten im Khlschrank wie eine Flasche Sekt  Wasser  Saft  Milch und Schokolade bis zur Verabschiedung Da unser Weiterflug sehr frh war sind beide um 530 aufgestanden um uns zu verabschieden Unglaublich Hilfsbereit und ausgesprochen herzlich Jedoch auch sehr diskret so das man fast meint man wohne alleine da. Das Appartement ist noch viel schner wie auf den Bildern zu vermuten Es ist super sauber  alles was man braucht ist vorhanden Jedes Detail ist genial durchdacht Der Ausblick atemberaubend Sonnenuntergnge zum trumen und genieen. Die Lage ist optimal fr Ausflge in die Stadt  zum Tafelberg Seilbahnstation ca 5 min mit dem Auto entfernt und ans Cap. In Camps Bay selber gibt es herrliche Strnde und super Essen. Wenn man etwas besser zu Fu ist kann man die Promenade mit den Restaurants per pedes erreichen. Der Rckweg ist allerdings etwas steiler. Wir htten am liebsten sofort fr Februar erneut gebucht  jedoch ist hier bereits alles voll. Wir knnen den Aufenthalt hier nur wrmstens empfehlen und kommen ganz bestimmt wieder Vielen lieben Dank nochmal euch beiden fr die wunderschne Zeit die wir bei euch verbringen durften Alexandra und Jrgen
933618,117117469,2016-12-04,22107559,Jrg,The apartment is very nice It is clean and everything is as described. The pool and the view are great. The hosts were friendly and helpfull. We will come back.

Jono and Colin are great hosts and their accommodations are great for two people. We were there for 5 nights and we couldn't have picked a better spot.  Clean  comfortable bed  a view to die for and relatively close to everything.  If I could give it 6 star rating  I would

Jono and Colin are fantastic hosts warm  funny  informative and inviting. The apartment itself is well fitted out with everything you need for a short or long stay. I would give this place 6 stars if I could.  Be warned though  once you arrive at Primaview you will find yourself transfixed with the views and you may not get around to doing everything else you planned to do in Cape Town
933618,195380885,2017-09-19,85805257,Ryan,This place is a dream. It has the best views and is perfect for any stay in Camps Bay. We loved the pool Easily walkable to the beach front and if you don't fancy the walk there are so many Uber's available. Jono was an extremely welcoming host and we felt very safe and comfortable during our stay. We will most definitely be returning. Thanks Jono
650049,124899397,2017-01-03,60666325,Simon,Two weeks over Xmas and NYE  and we could not have stayed in a better accommodation. Flat is excellent and offers beautiful views of the mountain and a convenient location close to everything. Claire is a wonderful hostess who is very responsive and available to help answer questionsgive recommendations to local must-visits. You can truly feel 'at home' here  sipping a glass of wine on the balcony watching the sun set behind the Lion's Head.
650049,126590092,2017-01-13,37920723,Rebecca,We had a fantastic time in Claire's apartment. Checkin was really easy - we just picked up the keys from the security desk. The view was stunning and the apartment felt really safe and comfortable. We're very happy we stayed
650049,127302632,2017-01-17,62762539,Ambreia,THE place to stay in Cape Town.  Claire's place is both gorgeous  comfortable  and convenient.  There is a beautiful view of Table Mountain where I then hiked and abseiled.  I stayed two nights and dreaded having to leave.  I booked at the last minute and needed to store luggage - Claire was more than accommodating and on top of that  she provided a bottle of wine.  Thanks Claire
650049,130500112,2017-02-06,43755108,Stephanie,Great place to stay  apartment was very clean and left with everything for the perfect stay.  Location was good  a short walk from VA and also not far from HOHO bus stops. Didn't use the pool but looked very clean. View was great exactly as described of Table Mountain.
933618,215338914,2017-11-29,61070097,Henk,We had a fantastic stay at Primaview The views from the beautiful deck overlooking the large pool and than the ocean are indescribable. You want to sit there forever. The large apartment is very tasteful decorated and makes you feel right at home. It has everything you need and every little detail is just right. Great kitchen a fridge already filled with some basics a delicious shower and great bed with marvelous views outside. We just loved it Contact with Jono is easy via mail or whatsapp and response is quick. We could check in earlier without a problem and checkout late without extra charge Very warm and friendly. We will be back.
933618,217650937,2017-12-10,116581490,Zoe,Wow wow wow.. we had read such rave reviews about Jono and Collins apartment and we certainly werent disappointed. The place is A LOT more spacious than what the photos show and perfect for a couples holiday. The view is spectacular  by far the best spot in Camps Bay for a sundowner. On a arrival we were welcomed by Jono who had spoilt us with the first day necessities of water and other goods. The place was cleaned while we were there with refreshed towels and linen. I mean what a host The car parking space in the garage was fantastic especially on the windy nights Location wise is superb  5 min drive or 15 min walk to camps bay beach and bars. On the less windy days the pool is huge and fantastic for a day sunbathing. The area is so safe and we didnt hear anyone and would of liked to We are very much looking forward to coming back and staying at Prima Avenue and to see the wonderful hosts Jono and Collin.
933618,220201910,2017-12-21,45337328,Elena,Weve stayed for a few days in Jonos lovely apartment and everything was just great The view is amazing Perfect for a romantic break
933618,226903499,2018-01-13,19127078,Salvi,This is the second time that we are happy tenants at Primaries. The landlords are keeping this place so special  it is always a pleasure to come back. The flat is located at such a strategic location that the swimming pool and ocean are almost one. One of the tidiest place we stayed at. Many thanks to the owners
933618,231636964,2018-02-02,4914378,Jens C.,Simply wow We spend five wonderful nights and days at Jono  Colins house and we loved it Being hosts by ourselves we know that it is not easy to reach perfection - they did. The accommodation is stunning  Jono and Colin are very friendly and helpful - highly recommended
933618,237807243,2018-02-24,21434160,Benjamin,It was our second visit and even if we kinda knew what to expect we were blow'n away again. Great looks  great terrace  great pool  walking distance to lions head  table mountain. Just unrivaled  unbeaten location. It was hard to go out before sunset as it sets right in front of you.We stayed for 14 days and this was the perfect base for exploring the whole western cape. sad not to say we are coming back - for a third time 
933618,239729037,2018-03-03,50520485,Linda,Another fabulous stay at Primaview. Jono is a wonderful host who responds immediately to any query. The views are wonderful and it is a very relaxing place to stay. Love the new pool cover which has made the water quite warm See you again. Linda  David
933618,253717810,2018-04-15,58420194,Christian,Sehr gute Kommunikation  sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeber  tolle Lage der Unterkunft  sehr gute Ausstattung. Perfekte Bleibe fr Einzelpersonen oder Paare. Klasse
933618,260941592,2018-05-05,5304118,Maria,Es war absolut fantastisch und wie von allen Vorrednern schon beschrieben. Die Kommunikation mit Jono bereits lange vor Reiseantritt bezglich der Wasserknappheit in Kapstadt war absolut entgegenkommend. Das Apartment ist vollumfnglich ausgestattet und die Lage einfach nur perfekt. Man hat absolute Privatsphre  aber wenn ntig Ansprechpartner vor Ort. Die beiden sind so herzlich Wir wrden unglaublich gerne wieder kommen.
933618,263430920,2018-05-12,22981991,Johanna,Jono's and Colin's place exceeds what already looks amazing in these pictures. The studio feels like home the second you walk in and is so beautifully designed and well thought through. Jono and Colin put a lot of effort into making sure their guests have everything they need or would want -- from sparkling wine in the fridge to hammocks for the terrace plus much more.  We were welcomed so very warmly and truly felt like neighbors. The apartment is in Bakoven  an area of Camps Bay  that is just over the hill from Tamboerskloof and Garden  so it's really just a 5-10 min. taxi drive to go to all the barsrestaurantsshops etc. in city center. In addition  you'll find great places to wine and dine in Camps Bay that you can walk to and the neighboring Clifton as well  the beaches. The pool is squeaky clean and the views are amazing in all directions with Table Mountain in the back and the Atlantic in front of you. You won't want to leave  -- neither for sunrise nor sunset. We can't recommend this place enough there is really nothing we would recommend to change. Thank you  Jono and Colin We will definitely come back.
933618,266521827,2018-05-20,65201609,Perry,Jono was an excellent host who even left work during the day to let us check-in earlier than planned.  A beautiful home in beautiful Camps Bay in beautiful Cape Town....what else can you wish for  We will definitely recommend this property to any visitor and hope to return soon
933618,275534246,2018-06-11,33009345,Olaf,You are lucky if you find a place  like this.

650049,138232408,2017-03-19,3474678,Carolina,Great place for staying in Cape Town The apartment was just as it looks in the pictures  it was very cozy and comfortable and at the same time very beautiful and with an awesome view. We loved how closed it was to everything as well as the restaurant recommendations that Claire left us in the apartment. Overall great stay
650049,139039157,2017-03-23,8237060,Rob,The place was exactly as described and the location was great  we were able to walk to some great restaurants and bars.

650049,145870980,2017-04-20,13505453,Laura,Beautiful appartment with fantastic views for Table mountain. Excellent location with cafes near by.
650049,146587143,2017-04-23,26411068,Louise,Claire's place was very nice with scenic views We were greeted with a bottle of wine and were able to walk to close by bars restaurants  etc Would definitely recommend.
650049,147855411,2017-04-29,61008768,Seth,Claire is a thoughtful and caring host providing clear information about how to easily manage in the apartment. The view from the deck is lovely and the neighborhood had many positive features. Claire was very flexible and responsive to our needs making this a memorable visit.
650049,149037013,2017-05-02,883533,Shaz,We stayed at Claire's twice in a span of a week. We loved the central location of her apartment. The apartment is well equipped with an amazing view of Table mountain and Lion's head and the CBD below. We loved our stay at Claire's and cannot recommend it highly enough
650049,154588929,2017-05-25,66877346,Kerry,Absolutely gorgeous apartment and so many little well thought out gestures that made my whole stay incredible
650049,155031277,2017-05-27,65201609,Perry,My recent short stay at Claire's place was fantastic and wish I had more time to enjoy.  Although we didn't have a chance to meet during our stay  she ensured that were provided with all the necessary details of her place  the neighborhood and local sites.  I would definitely recommend this place for short and long stays in beautiful Cape Town
650049,164134447,2017-06-26,10959008,Vincent,Great location  lovely clean loft with a nice view. Keep in mind there is some construction happening close-by in case you want to sleep in on a Saturday  but on Sunday it's nice and quiet again. Claire is wonderful and very helpful.
650049,168836074,2017-07-10,27688836,Julia,Modern eingerichtetes Apartment  gut ausgestattet mit allem was es fr einen mehrtgigen Aufenthalt braucht. Gutes Bett mit hohem Schlafkomfort. Claire war fr uns jederzeit erreichbar und hat eine Broschre mit sehr vielen guten Tipps  Stadtfhrern und fantastischen Empfehlungen fr Restaurants zusammengestellt. Das war sehr hilfreich. Das Wachpersonal war stets aufmerksam und sehr freundlich. Fr unseren Mietwagen gab es einen bewachten Tiefgaragenstellplatz. Einziger Minuspunkt - auf den uns Claire aber im Voraus aufmerksam gemacht hatte - ist die Grobaustelle direkt auf der anderen Straenseite des Apartments. Die Geruschkulisse war trotz geschlossenen Fenstern sehr hoch und nichts fr empfindliche Gemter.
650049,171329729,2017-07-17,126968970,Michael,Claire was a great host  she was very prompt in responding to inquiries. The place was very clean and met our expectations. Great view from the balcony. She had great suggestions on what to do and where to go. She also has a great guide book in the apt with awesome suggestions on most of what Capetown has to offer. We used her suggestions and the guidebook quite a bit. We had a great time in Capetown. We plan on going back and would definitely look into staying at Claire's place again.
650049,191328448,2017-09-07,46872284,John,Great apartment  informative and responsive host  and fantastic location.  There was some construction noise but Claire was very clear and upfront about it prior to accepting me as a guest.  Highly recommended and would stay again if I make it back to Cape Town.
650049,199067619,2017-10-01,49860039,Amber,Claire is a great host. The apartment is stunning  clean  central with much attention to detail. Highly recommended.
650049,200157297,2017-10-04,131170818,Jordan,Amazing place to stay  we spent 4 days here and its was amazing  at the time of our stay we had construction works going but it didnt effect us as we were out all the time  the scenery was amazing  overall Id recommend this to everyone and anyone
650049,209831901,2017-11-06,103859243,Tania,Anything you would need in your own home  Claire has thought of. You literally feel like you are at home and not in a strangers flat. From having thought of spices to even having an HDMI cable available and hooked up to the TV Amazing amazing amazing
650049,212737610,2017-11-19,49603221,Dagmar,Das Appartement von Claire hat einen tollen Ausblick auf Tafelberg  Lionshead und Bokap. Leider wird ein Teil der Aussicht zuknftig durch ein Hochhaus verbaut sein  aber die Aussicht auf den Tafelberg bleibt so grandios laut Auskunft von Claire. Das Check-In war reibungslos  die Beschreibung von Claire eindeutig so wie die ganze Kommunikation mit ihr. Das Appartement ist sehr gut eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Es liegen sehr gute Informationen ber Kapstadt aus und die Restauranttipps - soweit wir sie bernommen haben - waren alle gut. Wir haben uns wohl gefhlt und werden - falls wir wieder nach Kapstadt kommen - sicherlich wieder versuchen bei Claire zu wohnen.
650049,213641081,2017-11-22,9501430,Clark,Claire's place in is a great central location. Lots a places withing walking distance.  The apartment was very clean and bed was comfortable.  Would highly recommend staying at Claires place
650049,227193107,2018-01-14,34777181,Chelsea,Claire's place is the ideal location if you are looking to stay in central Cape Town. Not only is it a clean and stylish apartment but the security guys at the front made us feel safe about leaving our stuff behind although that wasn't never an issue elsewhere in Cape Town  just extra peace of mind. The bed was super comfy Also  the restaurant guide Claire put together is better than anything you'll find online or in a guide book. De Waterkant  Bo Kaap  Bree Street  Table Mountain- everything is super close I can't recommend this place enough. We stayed at other air bnbs during our trip and this was by far the most professional of the lot.  Well done  Claire
933618,282314985,2018-06-27,21121182,Fiona,Jonos place is spectacular - if you are captured by the photos it is everything and more. Excellent location  views to die for and every comfort taken care of with the most welcoming of hosts. Book it you will love it.
933618,286897187,2018-07-07,194503728,Yaar,Very beautiful spot with the best view Really nice hosts.

933618,305353586,2018-08-11,22331518,Stefan,Very Nice and top located Appartment. Jono was a great host.
933618,315538508,2018-08-29,117678157,Michel,Impeccable sans aucune surprise un endroit  une vue exceptionnels. Un loft moderne avec des quipements de premire classe.  10 minutes en taxi du centre ville de Cape Town.
650049,228312967,2018-01-19,3208809,Lauren,Highly recommend staying here. Beautiful views  lovely host. We had a great time
650049,231643519,2018-02-02,8309200,Geir,Claires apartment is truly amazing. The location could not be better. You are in a safe area where there are lovely cafes  restaurants and shopping. You are also ideally situated for getting on the major routes getting around and out of the city. The apartment is perfect for a couple for a short or long stay. We stayed At the apartment for two weeks and found it very secure  quiet and convenient. The apartment has its own underground parking space. Claire had mentioned some building work opposite the apartment block and this was the case but this did not distract us at all. The apartment is very insulated and hence quiet. The apartment has tremendous views towards Table Mountain and Lions Head. We can highly recommend Claire as a host and her lovely apartment.
650049,233160003,2018-02-08,61898688,Alison,Wonderfully convenient with the most amazing view.  So easy to come and go and felt very secure. Thank you
650049,237029770,2018-02-21,25593365,Jennifer,The apartment was clean and well designed. Very central to everything in Cape Town. The building is safe and secure. Checkin and out was easy. Some wonderful touches  like wine for when we arrived  milk and water in the fridge. If you want to have a wonderful trip to Cape Town  then this place is for you.
650049,240077209,2018-03-04,51405970,Andrea,Loved the guide book and the property info book. Both were used quite a bit I also appreciated the quick responses to any questions I had. The condo comes equipped with everything one could need while on holiday. We thoroughly enjoyed the space. The view from the balcony is quite lovely regardless of the construction across the street. It was noisy but since we were gone most of the day  we hardly noticed it. One thing we did notice was the prayers that were held every morning at 515 due to the proximity to the mosques in the area. We were also given mixed  reviews from locals we interacted with about the area and we were encouraged to use Uber. Uber was inexpensive and quite reliable. I'm not sure if this is just a general rule for night time activities but we were advised against walking once the sun set in and around this area. During the day we did walk to the market and to a great little breakfast spot across the stairs over the road. We were honestly so busy during the days we didn't get to explore as much as we wanted to and in the evenings we had dinner at a few of the recommended places. Claire really has thought of everything to make guests feel welcomed.
650049,247646970,2018-03-29,1109660,Oisin,Awesome spot a quick Uber ride to all the big highlights

650049,265144432,2018-05-16,4972674,Lucas,Great place. Perfect for my three night business trip to CT
650049,266151973,2018-05-19,87151331,Philip,Het appartement is top op een fijne locatie. Inchecken en uitchecken is makkelijk en de parkeerplek is goed te bereiken. Wij zouden zeker terug gaan
650049,271776947,2018-06-02,3081978,Chrystina,Beautiful view out of a two story window of Table Mountain. Loved the neighborhood and this was such a great value. Check in and out was SUPER easy given that I could come late and still get in with no hassle. Would highly recommend staying in Claire's place.
650049,282023769,2018-06-26,190116855,Samir,Claire is a fantastic host and truly does go out od her way with how she makes you feel completely at home and you really do have the warmth of staying in a home away from home. Her repsonse time and help throughout this was amazing.  Perfect location  beautiful place and a great host. you won't go wrong at all.

650049,288918571,2018-07-11,145101441,Fidzis,If you're looking for clean  convenient and most importantly  feeling right at home in Cape Town  you'll have to pick Claire's place The VA Waterfront is a stone's throw away and so is the Bo-Kaap area. A spectacular view of Table Mountain awaits you from the comforts of the living space Easy check in and check out and not mention  the easy guides for the area makes it easy especially if it's your first time in Cape Town  as it was mine.  Had a wonderful stay. Recommended to the highest degree.
650049,290837555,2018-07-15,39215410,Sara,Beautiful view of Table Mountain though also some construction nearby no noise issue for us. Lovely space  great tips of local restaurants etc. We appreciated having 24 hour desk staff  made us feel safe.

650049,314082167,2018-08-26,86302063,Wilandi,Claires space is really fabulous. The location is excellent and Claire really walked the extra mile to make your visit very convenient. She even made personal notes on places to visit and what to expect  plugs you might need and proper utensils for the kitchen. Fine detail like milk in the fridge  fresh water and even a scale to weigh luggage for when you return to the airport. Claire is an excellent host and I will definitely use this accommodation again.
650049,327706928,2018-09-24,97203653,Kean Hee,Place has a great view of the Table Mountain.  I love that Claire compiled many nearby FB recommendations. You can find books to read at the apt as well

933618,328063282,2018-09-25,106922348,Colin,Cannot be highly enough recommended. Phenomenal evening views of the sea in the evening as the sun goes down or comes up over the mountains of the Twelve Apostles. What a super spot and Jono was ever helpful and the place more than could ever be expected including the hammocks.
933618,351837328,2018-11-24,159292814,Karin,This is really a great location to stay. The appartement is lovely with the best view an Camps Bay. Jono is a super host who cares for his guests. It s a good location for experiencing Capetown and surroundings.
933618,354293181,2018-12-01,183586384,Lara,We couldnt have had a better stay with Jono  Colin. We had heard fantastic things from other guests prior to booking and our stay certainly didnt disappoint. The apartment is absolutely immaculate and you feel like you are the first people to have ever stayed there. They have the best spot with the most fantastic views over camps bay and the sunsets are simply stunning. The apartment has everything youd need  more and the BBQ is great for dinner in on a nice evening. The spot in the garage is also nice security if you have a car. Jono is super quick at responding to any questions and is couldnt be more accommodating. If theres availability please dont hesitate to book 
933618,360054924,2018-12-19,115785334,Maria,Having booked 1 12 years in advance  our expectations for 4 Prima View were very high. On arrival  we were astounded and knocked speechless by the sheer beauty of the panoramic views the ocean to the front and the 12 Apostles and Table Mountain to the side and the rear. Everything to do with this apartment represents first class quality  from the architectural design of the building down to the bedding and towels. Jono and Colin were exceptional hosts and extremely welcoming and helpful and are responsible for my wife and I experiencing an unforgettable stay in beautiful Camps Bay.

We had no issues getting into the apartment and the 24 hour doormen in the lobby are very kind The property is great and exactly what we were looking for. Claire has 2 booklets of recommendations for anything you could want to do in Cape Town - such an amazing add-on. We went to a few of her recommended restaurants and they were fantastic. Everything was very cleanspotless and a very comfortable environment. The property is walking distance from VA and a quick cab ride to all the best spots on Cape Town. Would highly recommend staying here while in Cape Town

It has everything you need  there a two folders with loads of hand picked recommendations from the host. Go there But be aware that there is a huuuuge construction site on the opposite site of the street  so the pictures of the view and balcony are taken from a advantageous perspective'.

650049,453207403,2019-05-15,211452252,Michelle,Our favourite place to stay in the Cape Town city centre.  It's our home away from home - panoramic views of the mountain  sink-up-to-your-ears comfy bed  well stocked basics  sparkling clean.  We'll be back...

650049,480693364,2019-07-03,686367,Wally,Great loft space near many restaurants  bars and art galleries. Everything is a quick Uber ride away and the parking spot is great for those returning or leaving to do the Garden Route. Avis and Budget car rentals are conveniently close nearby. Only complaint would be that the shower is on the small size. Otherwise great space and location

She is also great at communicating and always there if you need her
650049,498775303,2019-07-30,89759350,Casey,The location of this Claire's place is fantastic Very easy to get to and nearby to many popular attractions. The parking garage and the building in general are very secure and safe. The parking space is pretty tight due to a post  so I'd recommend choosing a smaller car. Check in and check out were simple. Claire includes a great book of local recommendations with food  things to do  etc. Super clean  very comfortable Great amenities. Easy to get UBER Eats deliveries for any nights that you stay in. Overall  we had an absolutely wonderful stay and would highly recommend Claire's place to anyone staying in Cape Town
650049,506942581,2019-08-11,222340509,Georg,Our second time staying in this apartment and will definitely return. Stunning views  great location  neat and stylish with attention to detail and fine touches. Highly recommended.

This was one of the nicest places we have every stayed. It was perfectly clean. The shower is very nice. The couch is so comfortable. The view from the patio was the most incredible view that we found in all of Camps Bay. The Primaview is everything you could possibly need out of a home base for your trip to Cape Town. And last but not least  Jono is the best We were thrilled about every aspect of our stay  and we will no doubt stay at the Primaview again next time we are in Cape Town.

650049,623229836,2020-04-27,208261618,Jason,Claires apartment was a fantastic find and timely one. We moved in to the apartment before the Covid19 lockdown and spent a month in this wonderful place. It was comfortable  well-furnished  well-decorated and truly felt like a home away from home. The place offers an incredible view of Table Mountain every day  which can be seen both from the balcony or even from inside the apartment with its majestic windows which go from floor to ceiling. Claire was kind  friendly and reachable right from day one. We were welcomed into the apartment by a complimentary bottle of wine  which was very much appreciated Claire is a true Super-Host of a Luxe apartment The location was perfect  especially in lockdown  as we were just across the street from a grocery store  just a few minutes walk from the local mall and in an area with lots of shops and restaurants. The amenities in the apartment and in the building are wonderful additions e.g. washerdryer in the apartment  swimming pool  recycling bins  etc. With the security guard station always staffed  the apartment building is safe as well as comfortable. We will definitely look to stay here again when we return to Cape Town and will hopefully be able to enjoy more of the amenities and local treats without restrictions of a lockdown lol Thanks again Claire
650049,655339693,2020-08-23,195560676,Chris,We had a lovely time at Claires place Perfect location  amazing view 
650049,667012716,2020-09-22,33232388,Tasneem,Stayed at Claire's place for a month while working remotely  and it was absolutely perfect. The Wi-Fi remained connected for the entire period  and the apartment is within walking distance to at least 5 of Cape Town's best coffee spots  and I have to mention that the view from the balcony is breathtaking. The apartment is also equipped with all the necessary amenities for a long-term stay. Claire is a friendly and responsive host  and I can highly recommend this place as a great home away from home.
650049,669505170,2020-09-30,262572197,Abigail,This is the perfect place for a get away or work and even long stays   great apartment and everything you need is there.
650049,704991326,2020-10-30,361150760,Mbali,The place is convenient and close to all popular spots  malls  beach   freeway. The parking bay is very narrow  needs a smaller car.
650049,746034344,2021-04-05,15835740,Michael,Centrally located with a beautiful view of the Table mountain. We loved hanging out on the balcony. Loved the double tall windows that made the place bright and spacious. The home had all of the essentials and felt secure. The host was super helpful and was very pleasant to communicate with.
650049,751448436,2021-04-24,22444063,Marcie,I enjoyed my stay here It has a beautiful view of Table Mountain  especially from the balcony. The floor-to-ceiling windows make it a bright space. And for those working while traveling  it has a proper office chair.

650049,484502362100649918,2021-10-30,98464099,Alysa,Our stay was so easy and convenient. We felt at home in the space and loved how central the location was. Claire thought of every detail. The space was clean and comfortable the bed is so comfortable and the view from the balcony is amazing. We really loved our stay and have already shared the link to the listing with a few friends to personally recommend it to them personally. We accidentally forgot a few items in the flat when we left  and Claire went above and beyond to help get them back to us. We also felt very safe in the building where there is extra security and an underground parking.
650049,490388597014317630,2021-11-07,153770111,Tim,We really enjoyed our stay in the loft. It is located in a safe and central area. The view from the balcony is incredible  you can see the city center and the table mountain. Claire helped us with every single question we had and told us many of her favorite restaurants  shops and activities in the city and in the surrounding area. The appartment is beautiful and very well equipped. We would always come back again
650049,511338245164864902,2021-12-06,130356638,Alex,Loved this place Extremely cozy great view of table mountain. Would 100 stay here again on my next trip

650049,551198347683363110,2022-01-30,333275229,Elias,Claires apartment was amazing. Nicely decorated and spacious with a beautiful balcony and stunning view of table mountain. The location in the heat of De Waterkant is also perfect right next to stores  gyms  bars and excellent restaurants. Claire was also very accommodating and quick to respond not that you really needed it bc she had put together a curated list of both the apartment and surrounding area with personal recommendations. If there is one thing to be aware of  there is no dishwasher  which for longer term stays is a bit inconvenient. Would 1010 come and stay again
933618,545304714,2019-10-12,51080211,Katie,If Prima View is available book it You will not regret it The location is incredible and Jono is such a thoughtful host We stayed 7 nights and wish we could have stayed seven more. Best Airbnb stay ever
933618,552330149,2019-10-21,18314675,Holly,Absolutely amazing Not only is Jono such a great host  his Airbnb is perfection Check in was a breeze  perfect location and a view to die for The photos do not do this place justice its absolute heaven Jono gave us lots of tips while we were in Cape Town  we had 5 nights here and wished we had booked longer. Thanks Jono  we cant wait to come back
933618,554429311,2019-10-26,107787410,Sabine,Die Unterkunft hat eine fantastische Lage. Sie ist mit allem ausgestattet was man braucht und alles war blitzsauber. Unser Gastgeber hat uns sehr freundlich empfangen und alles erklrt. Wir haben uns super wohl gefhlt und kommen ganz sicher wieder.
933618,576729759,2019-12-14,232941550,Monia,We had great days at this accommodation. We enjoyed the great view and luxury of having our own pool every day. The apartment was very clean and nothing was missing. We can really recommend this accommodation.
933618,579640343,2019-12-21,1670493,Corylie,The stay at Jonos place truly exceeded our expectations. We arrived quite late in the evening and Jono was continuously in touch with us until we arrived where he greeted us personally and even helped us with our heavy bags down the stairs. Upon entering the apartment we were in awe of how clean and spacious the place was. Jono was so kind to show us everything in the apartment and even had a basic items for us including a bottle of bubbles in the fridge When we woke up  we couldnt believe our eyes of how gorgeous the view was and how serene the location was. The pictures are beautiful but the view in real life is out of this world. Unfortunately the weather was quite terrible the week we were there so we couldnt use the pool but we will most certainly book at Jonos place next time were in Cape Town and hopefully be able to enjoy some sundowners and pool time. Overall The place is incredible  sparkling clean and Has the best host weve experienced so far.  Jono was responsive every single time we needed something or had any questions. Upon checkout he was there to say goodbye and wish us a safe flight. If youre desired dates arent booked at Jonos place  we suggest you book and enjoy You wont regret it.

Jono is a great host and was replacing our towels after a couple of days and cleaned the pool even though it was only us that used it. This place is everything one can look for and we will definitely try to book it again

Jono was a truly wonderful and friendly host and the pictures dont really do justice to the place.  Its a bit far to walk to Camps Bay so I would recommend a car but the location is marvellous  quiet  stylish and private.  We would definitely come again and use as a base to explore more of the Western Cape

Every sunset there is more magical than the last Lying out on the deck loungers or hammocks for serene and sunny pool days was our favourite way to spend the day. Jono and Chris are the most hospitable hosts so friendly  gave us so much privacy and yet made sure we had anything we could possibly need It really felt like we were in a hotel The location is also perfect in Camps Bay and close to beach  hike and shopsrestaurants. Thank you so much Jono - it was a dreamy week and we will definitely visit again

The kitchen was well stocked with supplies to cook at home. Yet Uber drivers were only a minute away if we wanted to go out. There is a grocery store within walking distance. The front door security was very friendly and helpful. And Claire provides very thorough guest books to guide you around the city. Definitely recommend staying here if you are a first-time visitor to Cape Town.

Although the pictures already look perfect  the place is even better in reality - obviously the view is incredible. The place had cute little details and there was not a single piece missing. Jono even stocked the fridge with a few drinks. Hands down  this was my best airbnb experience. The only negative thing is the fact that you will have to leave this place. Many thanks for making our stay so wonderful

All the facilities are top draw  its a nice size to use as a base for a stay in the Cape Town area plus it has on site parking. A lovely garden to complete the setting along with the pool. If  when we ever return this will be top of the list for our accommodation

We loved hanging around the pool and enjoying the view over the ocean  especially during sunset. Lions head is just a short walk from the accommodation and you can easily catch an Uber to head to the other parts of Cape Town. Jono was a very friendly host and made sure we had all the information that we needed. Communication also went very smoothly. I would definitely recommend this place

We had everything we needed and Jono was very responsive and accommodating We didnt rent a car but using Ubers in the area was quick  easy  affordable  and efficient. The home is within  walking distance to the beach as well as some of the hiking trails and we felt very safe in the area. Having Jono and Colin on the property made us feel even more at ease  but they also gave us our privacy. All and all it was a great stay and we hope to be able to stay again in the future Thanks for being awesome hosts

I cant wait to return to Cape Town just to stay in this Airbnb again. The pool was amazing  there were cozy hammocks  lounge chairs and the best part was the stunning view over Camps Bay. The neighborhood is great- we walked down to the Camps Bay restaurants about 15 min because you kind of wind down the hill and also took some cheap Ubers to and from the Main Street. The Airbnb itself was beautiful and clean  and Jono was very accommodating of our late almost 11pm arrival. A perfect experience
933618,1146234084517353584,2024-04-30,14533112,Walt,My wife and I stayed at Jonos after a family vacation in Plett. His  communication was prompt  friendly. The rental is beautiful  private and extremely clean. The view is spectacular. We would definitely stay there again.

Either then that it was all good. He has a great place honestly andI would recommend it

969627,24652092,2015-01-01,5105100,Henk,De woning was precies zoals geadverteerd en alles kwam overeen met de foto's op de website. Ik vond de tuin en het zwembad zelfs mooier dan op de foto's  dus wij waren zeer tevreden. De adverteerder heeft van te voren informatie gestuurd over de woning en de omgeving en bij aankomst kregen we een goede rondleiding door het huis. De buurt was goed en het huis was goed beveiligd  zoals te doen gebruikelijk in Zuid Afrika. De ontvangst was hartelijk en we kregen veel tips over wat te doen in de omgeving  waar te eten  etc. Het huis was goed ingericht met alle nodige apparatuur om zelf te kunnen koken en barbecuen. Al met al waren wij heel tevreden over ons verblijf.
969627,115380505,2016-11-24,22891216,Sarah,This is a very comfortable home and place to stay - everything was as described and Laura was very helpful but unintrusive.

1013146,8920724,2013-11-25,1719431,Dimitri,We felt very welcome in this great warm family hosting a cosy room in beautiful house. As we wanted to go to CT city center  Hermanus and Muizenberg the house was conveniently located. We had a really great weekend here.Thanks
1013146,21580999,2014-10-20,8983438,Oliver,We're so happy that we found this airbnb home -- and that Katrine and her family accepted us as guests. The house itself is extremely comfortable  the garden is really beautiful and the location convenient for both the city centre and for all points around the Cape Peninsula. Best of all was the warmth of the welcome by all the members of the family. Cape Town and the surrounding area is absolutely fascinating  but Katrine's family really made our stay special. We were given so much invaluable advice as to places to visit  restaurants to try and shops to go to for things that we were seeking. It was great to be with people who always seemed happy to answer our questions relating to aspects of Cape Town history  politics and life in general. From the moment we arrived as it happened  just before dinner -- which we were invited to share with the family until our departure  this really felt like a home away from home. We can't wait to return to Cape Town.....hopefully Katrine and family will remain airbnb hosts. Katrine  Gaby  Andries  Hannah  Jake and your lovely cats thank you so much
1013146,26896626,2015-02-21,133951,Enrique,Looking for a hosting Ive found a family. Warming and kind welcoming  they made me felt like at home  become part of the family at their great house. Sometimes life brings you the opportunity to meet these kind of people will shake your soul. Not just about the house but the people on it  you could not expect a better place to stay in.
1013146,56349801,2015-12-12,26252121,Claudia,Staying with Katrin's exuberant  artistic family was a nice and diverting experience. The room is as described  the villa a historical  beautiful place full of art surrounded by flowers  birds in a green  cosy paradise I haven't seen Katrin much  but enjoyed chats with her father  mother and sister about SA's cultural past  present and future. We went out for a drink or dinner twice  which was lovely. Again a home away from home
1013146,65488855,2016-03-15,41676587,Philippe,Un accueil super sympa  une famille trs agreable

They are open  inclusive and love spending time with their guests. I very quickly felt at home and now that I have returned to Europe definitely left a piece of my heart there. I am for sure going to return in the future.
1040292,25349604,2015-01-13,21478252,Simon,Wir haben 2 Wochen in Cape Town verbracht und durchgngig im Mutual Hights Building im Appartement gewohnt. Wir haben alles  wie  hier beschrieben  vorgefunden und haben uns wohl gefhlt. Es ist sehr zentral gelegen  so dass wir von hier aus die gesamte Stadt und das Umland leicht erreichen konnten. Ausserdem haben wir uns stetig sicher gefhlt  da es eine stndig besetzte Rezeption und ein berwachtes Parkhaus gibt. Einziger Wermutstropfen ist die Geruschkulisse der Klimaanlage gewesen. Dennoch wrden wir das Appartment durchaus weiterempfehlen.
1040292,26528815,2015-02-15,2741949,Karoline,I enjoyed a seamless experience through Afribode and Lou-Ann and her team are very responsive and professional. The flat is comfortable  bright and exactly as described. I particularly enjoyed the pool access to the building next door which can be accessed via an air walk and is open from 6.30am to 10pm. Overall  excellent service and experience
1040329,63153563,2016-02-21,13855269,Jonathan,This was really the perfect base for our family to explore Cape Town from.  From the initial check in process through to the final contact the hosts were thoughtful  considerate and efficient.  The facilities were even better than we had anticipated and the apartment itself was very well arranged with amazing views over the city and table mountain.
1040329,65381252,2016-03-13,24923497,Inga,It is one of the greatest places I've ever been to. A very big  bright appartment with an awesome view on Table Mountain. The cleaning ladies also do an amazing job every time they are there. The pool is worth going  too. There are many nice bars and clubs nearby as well as museums and shopping malls. The area around the building seems to be quite  lively and safe to walk around.
1040329,110263260,2016-10-25,28090006,Gordon,Crisp  clean and conveniently located the Mutual Heights apartment offers great proximity to all historical places of interests as well as entertainment spots itself being an Art Deco lovers dream. Interactions with the host were seamless.
1040329,111834964,2016-11-02,63488642,Ciaran,Afribode communicated well with us. The location is central for the Downtown area. The apartment itself was very clean  open and spacious very well presented and as described in the listing. Wifi is available but this must be purchased separately. I would recommend this apartment
1040329,761278344,2021-05-23,268836652,Carol,The place was amazing plus it was close to long street and everything else  most of all the host was really helpful at all times. I really had such a great time and I would fully recommend them without a doubt.

1041922,10673566,2014-03-03,7332412,Eva,Vi stannade i en vecka. tre familjer bodde tillsammans. Vi hyrde hela huset. Vi fick tv swimmingpooler vilket var fantastiskt d den ena famlijen hade morgontidiga barn och kunde ha den undre vningen. Inredningen var toppen. Mycket yta d vi var 12 personer som t tillsammans ovh spenderade mycket tid ihop. Nrhet till Kapstaden och Waterfront. Underbar utsikt frn huset. Dessutom ingick en hemhjlp fem dagar. Det blev lata dagar fr oss alla. Villa med hotellstandard. Kket fungerade utmrkt. Hrligt med tvttmaskin fr barnfamiljerna. En helt igenom lyckad vistelse.
1041922,15570422,2014-07-12,13594041,Ryan,Fabulous place

1041922,32503725,2015-05-19,8519323,Clair,Fantastic house  perfect for a group or families. Lovely location. Upper pool really tops off the house with a great view over camps bay. All contact was responded to very quickly and was really helpful when planning our trip. I would definitely recommend the house and the service provided by James and his team.
1041922,33374696,2015-05-27,6756851,Dorsa,Perfection There is nothing more I would ask for. Clean  comfortable  and beautiful. With easy access to all parts of Cape Town.  I will definitely book this again on my next trip  preferably in the summer months so I can enjoy everything the house offers
1041922,36079777,2015-06-25,21623082,Viv,Unfortunately we were unable to make contact with the host when we arrived at 7 p.m at Capetown Airport. We drove out to the house hoping James would be there to meet us but found everything locked  though the lights were on. After ringing James again a very quiet message informed us he was out of the country and gave us an alternative office number to try. We couldn't contact the office number due to being after hours. In desperation we called out to neighbours and luckily found they had a key and access for us. The neighbour had been waiting to hear from us  but we had not been informed of any alternative arrangements in regard to our arrival. This wasn't a great start  but after gaining access  the house proved very appropriate to our needs and we enjoyed our stay.
1041922,52680395,2015-11-01,31989474,Freek,Perfect location  beautiful house  very clean An absolute suggestion

667072,131015440,2017-02-10,112092982,Joe,Diana's is a beautiful property overlooking Hout Bay.  Gorgeous gardens  living area  and stoop.  The sunset views over the bay from our bedroom were breathtaking.  Diana was such a lovely host too and made us the most amazing breakfasts.  We can't wait to come back.  Thank you for such a lovely stay.
667072,133248800,2017-02-21,49454597,Dani,We can't thank Di  Don enough for adding to our Cape town experience. Their beautiful home on the hill of Scott Estate was the perfect place to base ourselves for our time in Cape Town. The home was warm  amazingly styled  had the most breathtaking view from our room  the large verandah of Hout Bay. Our room was large  clean  the king bed was super comfortable. Di  Don made us very welcome  Di cooked up a delicious breakfast daily. Our room neighbours were also very lovely  added to our experience. We definitely recommend Diana's home and are already thinking about our next visit.
667072,213994896,2017-11-24,143337764,Alexandra,It was a great visit We would love to come again.
667072,225040585,2018-01-05,22984995,Erin,Diana and Dons home is spectacular  inside and out. Beautiful views  outstanding style  and perfect hospitality. Diana and Don are the best part  kindly entertaining our little toddler throughout the stay. We would come back in a heartbeat.

667072,351856580,2018-11-24,18047672,Michel,FABULOUS  This is the word that comes to mind when thinking about our stay at Diana and Dons. We have had great experiences with AirBnB all over the world but this one was  BY FAR  THE BEST ONE. Diana and Don are wonderful people who care for their guests and the flat is just FANTASTIC  It is safe and quiet  it is spacious  it is clean and clear  comfortable  fully equipped and beautifully furnished and decorated. The view over Hout Bay from the large terrasse and the picture windows in the bedroom is ABSOLUTELY stunning. Besides  the location is ideal as Hout Bay is about halfway between Cape town city centre and Cape Point  which means you are within very short driving distance from every place you might like to visit on the peninsula. We HIGHLY recommend the place and express our deepest gratefulness to Diana and Don.
667072,354599968,2018-12-02,25669884,Karin,very nice atmosphere. Phantastic view. Very spacious. Very clean. We come back Thank you. Karin4
667072,357684853,2018-12-11,31902907,Claudia,We had a wonderful time in Hout Bay. The apartment was fabulous  especially the view from the balcony was outstanding. Diana and Don are very nice hosts. Thank you so much for letting us stay at your place.
667072,362374924,2018-12-26,117486471,Deb,Dear Traveler   Words cannot do justice to the exceptional experience you will have at Diana's home. The gardens  house  hospitality and the views are all beyond any traveler's expectations. The house location in Hout Bay was excellent for us since we had a car and prefer to get out of the center of a big city at the end of a wonderful day. The neighborhood is safe and the stores are easily accessible. There are great places to eat and fun coffee shops in the neighborhood. Everything a person needs is here.  My only regret is that I would have planned on staying longer with Diana and her charming host husband.
1041922,101318335,2016-09-12,21409141,Lyall,Fantastic location  and amazing property home with plenty of space for 6 couples as was the case with our holiday to thoroughly relax and enjoy. There is a good split with 2 bedrooms being downstairs  along with a kitchen and lounge  ideal for those who need a nap or want a bit of privacy from the rest of the main house upstairs. I would highly recommend staying at James' place for families and large groups.
1041922,104756608,2016-09-28,96867438,George,The Villa is even better in reality  beautifully located and the staff offered comfort and exceptional hospitality. The balcony is perfect for relaxations  breakfasts and evenings. James is an amazing host  extremely attentive and helpful  with anything we needed Anything from recommendations to what to do in the area to practical help of finding taxi for us in the early morning to arrange transportation to the airport. He is a great communicator and you notice that he loves hosting. I highly recommend this place
1041922,116720196,2016-12-02,58616377,Andrew,Clean  tidy and a perfect location as a base to explore Camps Bay and the Cape Peninsular. Would book again.

1041922,152136115,2017-05-15,72264152,Jaco,Our team of ten unrelated people had a fantastic time. The house is amazing and everything worked perfectly. Of course  with this location I would suggest that you would have independent transportation  but that is a small price to pay. Nothing beats the view. We traveled extensively during the day and enjoyed playing board games in the evenings. The house's layout works great for what we wanted to do. Nancy did great to have the house clean again upon our return in the late afternoons. It was a true pleasure staying here
1041922,166926378,2017-07-05,115475697,Alvaro Jose,casa com optimas condies para familias. Prxima do mar com bela vista. Boa soluo para passer um fim de semana em cape town

The apartment is sparkling clean and well equipped and furnished to a high standard. The beds in particular are large and very comfortable and I had the best night sleep here in South Africa  waking up to the birds singing. Diana place is a unique stay in paradise   Stephanie  Michael Devon UK.
667072,719616271,2020-12-30,46939441,Julia,Diana und dann sind sehr zuverlssige Gastgeberinnen  die Unterkunft befindet sich am Hang mit einem fantastischen Blick auf Hout Bay  den besten Ort wo du in Cape Town wohnen kannst.

667072,767963721895240682,2022-11-25,396725962,Eugenio,Diana's accommodation is a gem nestled on the hillside of Hout Bay overlooking the bay. The view is breathtaking  while the accurate furnishings express Diana's sensitivity and refined taste well. The apartment - one of a kind - is suitably divided into two sub-units. The first one  accessed from the main door  opens onto the kitchen. Then it widens towards a comfortable living room with large windows  one facing west and the other opening onto a porch overlooking the bay. A door on the right leads to the master bedroom and a vestibule with the primary bathroom. You have access to the second unit from the French window that opens onto the porch. From there  you go to a delightful double bedroom with windows overlooking a French garden with the bay in the background. This room is also equipped with a comfortable en-suite bathroom. Diana is such a lovely hostess  always attentive to satisfy any request you may have.

1043446,556324761735579029,2022-02-06,112671260,Alexander,Unfortunatley this was not the place for me. The check in procedure was tedious with finger prints and ID  going up one lift with all our luggage and then down another for check in and then back up again to the apartment. Also finding the place was harder than normal thankfully the manager was there to assist. I also feel that for the nightly price very little was provided in the sense of toiletries x2 small soap. I also suggest besides having a portable AC unit the loft room is boiling hot and should have a fan atleast to have some air flow circulation. Wifi was not the best as we could hardly get a chance yo watch netflix it was always overloaded. Some small changes would certainly make this place much better. Give more to the client 
1043446,753403653916520865,2022-11-05,339838204,Rashid,I loved this loft. The design of the apartment itself is very unique and very beautiful. I enjoyed my stay more than anything. And all the amenities listed were available. I will definitely book again. 5 star experience

1044351,9670752,2014-01-05,6013406,Carla,AfriBodes client services was very good and responsiveness.  The apartment was ready and clean when we arrived.  The apartment itself is well located and with easy acess to main atractions  transport  restaurantes and night life Dont miss Long street.  The building in which the apartment is is gourgeous Just the building itself is a great experience.  Gym and pool  eventough in a separate building  where well connected and with easy access.  The apartment we ended up in the African Love Nest itself is small and cozy.  It looks better in pictures than in reality. It is smaller than it looks. It was well equiped in the kitchen but no washdry machine which became an issue if long stay.  Leaving features a TV but does not have any dvd player andor music stereo. This is a miss considering the TVCable features to few good channels. The balcony does not open to the street but to an internal corridor with no privacy and no views. This shall be explain in the page as we though it had a balcony that opens to the street and thats why we chose the apartment. The apartment has not air condition and the movil one that is provided did not work well. This is really bad during summer.  The apartment became very hot and its non confortable being inside  even worst you can not open the windows and balcony as if so  there is no privacy.  We highly recommend to consider that fact if thinking in this apartment.
668544,607081575554095908,2022-04-17,11759168,Chris,Hi Brenda thanks for letting us stay in your lovely accommodation. Everything was perfect from all the things you left for us on our arrival bread  butter  wine and other stuff to making everything so comfortable like cushions for the sun loungers and the table cloth for the outdoor dining area. Llandudno is a beautiful place and having somewhere with private parking and a stones throw from the beach couldnt get better really. Also thanks for the help you and Patience gave to us during out stay it was much appreciated. Wouldnt hesitate for a second to recommend to other travellers in the area. It was a pleasure to meet you and Patience Thank You
668544,757762329410456600,2022-11-11,6291618,Aisling,Great house in fantastic beach location. We stayed with two young children and it provided a great location to explore beaches Llandudno a short walk and many others a short drive  table mountain  VA waterfront etc. Lovely host and great communication. The house is very clean and comfortable and well set up. Brenda went out of her way to provide child gates and a high chair to make sure we had everything we need Thank you
668544,807053456259942756,2023-01-18,124578781,Jamie,We absolutely loved our stay - the place was perfect. Immaculate and beautiful interiors  the private pool was great  location couldnt be better right by the beach - and Brenda was a wonderful host. We would definitely come back
668544,836789938911629602,2023-02-28,272014859,Anne,Beautiful 2 bedroom flat only 100 metres from one of the most beautiful beaches near Capetown. Very light and cosy at the same time with a very nice garden and Swimmingpool. We absolutely loved the secluded and exclusive feel of the apartment and Brenda had brought some fruit and milk  water  butter  wine to fill the fridge which was very useful since there isnt a shop nor restaurant in the neighbourhood. But food ordering was no problem and Hout Bay is just 10 ms away. Despite load shedding everything worked perfectly all the time which was a nice plus. So all in all a wonderful experience in beautiful Llundadno.
668544,853445965273280576,2023-03-23,188519974,Sarah,A lovely apartment in a magical part of the world

668544,1097032971821226397,2024-02-22,362561799,Kathryn,Brendas place is first class. I could not recommend it more highly. The location is beautiful and very close to just about the best beach in Cape Town. The accommodation was great  everything was very comfortable and very clean and cleaning and linen changing were done for no extra fee during our stay. Thank you Brenda.
668544,1099924374118173406,2024-02-26,22625238,Emily,Brendas home is beautiful. We had the dreamiest few days and we wish we could have stayed longer. Brenda gives you the warmest of welcomes and makes you never want to leave

1044351,513481689454564006,2021-12-09,431464641,Pule,Lovely apartment and great location.
1046677,65661254,2016-03-16,58803302,Chanhee,The host was very professional. We managed to check-in before time which was very helpful. Area was quiet and also had a nice view of the surrounding areas. Everything was excellent. I would highly recommend this place and also would definitely go back next time im back in Cape Town.
1046677,68028468,2016-04-01,34902766,Davide,Afribode are managing a bunch of flats in town. Besides some initial confusion we ended up in a flat inside an old insurance building not the one here. The flat comes with a nice view to the table mountain and quiet for being in the city center. Long str.  bree str. are just walking distances away. What I missed were the insider tips about the city.
1046677,71064095,2016-04-23,608129,Tsion,The neighberhood was awesome. Central location to all major attractions. The hose was very helpful.
1046677,510584673184828720,2021-12-05,77762193,Mackenzie,Beautiful apartment and lovely host I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here

1047449,47539100,2015-09-20,12647630,Dan,We really enjoyed at our stay in the Aeicon Suite. The apartment has everything you could possibly need  including a great gym and pool  and is located in a very handy area of Cape Town - a short walk away from the Waterfront and not far from areas like Kloof Street. We would definitely look into staying here again.
1047449,75352208,2016-05-20,18703267,Peter,The apartment is located near to the convention center  the waterfront and long street. A perfect location for business or a vacation. The apartment is spacious and very clean and delivers absolutely value for money.
1047449,467104019933954728,2021-10-06,219564900,Dudu,It was lovely.
1047449,773049746538446749,2022-12-02,477525638,Tomaza,Accommodating host. Clean apartment. Very convenient location.
1047449,795449977884871925,2023-01-02,142226847,Angelique,A spacious apartment with everything to make you feel comfortable. The lifts dont always work but other than that a pleasant stay. There is parking available and a pool  we could use the washing machine and tumbler  no issues with Wi-Fi. It gets a bit hot but the place was super clean. Host super responsive  always finds solutions to any problem. Responds almost immediately
1047449,833194590486203780,2023-02-23,4254454,Naledi,Great location. Unit exacty as described in safe secure location  and host was extremely responsive.
1049807,61283876,2016-02-02,11088629,Tony,very nice apartment and very well located. I would always come back
1049807,189326581,2017-09-01,38234978,Fiona,Great location  great mountain view
1049807,416233715,2019-02-24,188686444,Leonard,Good location
1049807,569318161880477387,2022-02-24,67649654,Kelly,Great place. Recommend to all and wanna revisit. Location is really good and security system in the building is the best. One thing which was disappointing is broken air conditioning  which was not informed. But electricity fans were there.
669623,10584681,2014-02-26,6070599,Stefanie,The house is very characterful and homely. It is very generous inside  with three big bedrooms and the option of a reserve bed in the forth room. Outside is beautifully maintained apart from the swimming pool  where it took a while to work out how to clean it  but Mario the owner of the property   was on hand to resolve the situation. The area is secure  with breathtaking views to the Atlantic. They're are numerous good eateries within easy driving distance. The foodbarn probably the most notable at Nordhoek. As a relaxing place  with plenty to do around and about I would highly recommend this as a holiday destination. Debbie the cleaner is also a diamond
669623,12094327,2014-04-22,1659525,Adrian,Well looked after and stylishly decorated house. All of the 3 main rooms are very spacious and also have their own en-suite bathrooms. Awesome outside outside braai and pool area too just a pity the wind didn't play along on our stay. Mario was a very friendly and accommodating host.
669623,23544692,2014-12-04,3653495,Julia,This is a lovely looking house  nicely furnished with a well-equipped kitchen  but unfortunately we had a lot of problems  of which not all are mentioned here. Our host Mario said he would provide a cot and did not mention that there would costs for that. On arrival I asked about the cot and was told that he had forgotten about it  but that another guest had left a cot behind and we could use it without charge for 2 nights and then it would be picked up or we could rent it and pay R 150 per day  which is exorbitant. The house is listed as 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms  sleeps 8. The 4th bedroom is not furnished as a bedroom  it has no closets and the sleeper couch is for 1 person. The 4th bathroom is a guest toilet  not a full bathroom. We booked this property for 2 weeks and all the closets except for 1 in the main bedroom were full. I had to personally remove all the contents of the closets and put the stuff in the garage so that we could hang up our clothes. There were no waste-paper baskets in the bedrooms or bathrooms and we had to regularly fix the flushers of the toilets downstairs. The door of the shower in the main bedroom did not close properly  which resulted in a very wet bathroom floor. The window in the lounge did not lock  so when we left the house we had to lock up all our valuables. The alarm when it went on  was really soft  so did not work either. On both sides of the property there was construction  so we were surrounded by builders and overlooked their outdoor toilet 8 meters away from one of the bedrooms. I understand that this can happen but because we could not lock the house properly we did not feel that our belongings were safe when we were not there and we had little privacy when sitting in the garden. The pool went green  we had no proper instructions and no chemicals to keep the pool maintained. I suggest the owner leave some written instructions as to how to keep the pool properly maintained  especially with all the dust etc  from the construction work on both sides of the property. The worst thing that happened is that we ran out of electricity twice. The owner did not put enough electricity on the card and the second time when I tried to reach him about the problem  he did not answer his emailphone for 2 days. We went and bought elecricity ourselves and Mario said he would reimburse us the R200. However he has not done so and was also not at the check-out at the time agreed  so we left the house without personally handing over the keys and getting the R200 back. We were also not informed by the owner that there would be load-shedding in the area  so on Saturday...
669623,25432935,2015-01-16,14892380,Charles,We had an incredible time. Waking up to the view of Chapman's Peak every morning was magic. Mario is friendly and extremely helpful. The house is a delight - one of those rare experiences where the real life experience is actually better than the pictures. The house is really well equipped and comfortable.  I highly recommend this property.
669623,29810333,2015-04-13,22487623,Kim,Mario was a lovely host. He always communicated with us  and was helpful with the booking. When we arrived  the house was fantastic it looked exactly as it does on the images. Mario showed us around the whole house and explained how everything worked. The house was clean and tidy  homely and just as we had imagined. When the electricity ran out  I let Mario know and he immediately re-loaded it. The house is in a private security complex  which was great  and is a short drive from Kommetjie long beach.
669623,529452406698529925,2021-12-31,208907126,Tamara,Mario lied to us by having space for 6 guests as described on the listing only to call on the check-in day and say theres only space for 4. Furthermore this was the first piece of communication from him we had received since the booking was confirmed Then he proceeded to cancel on us on the day of check-in. You be the judge.
669623,841092289047179690,2023-03-06,9114151,Linda,Had a good stay.
672103,3260845,2013-01-04,3632889,Simon,We had an amazing stay at the Magical manor house. The house is absolutely beautiful  they have a super big garden and a big pool area. The house was very clean  the rooms were big  and everything worked perfectly. The hosts Lindy and Marc are super friendly and gave us a lot of good advice on what to do in cape Town during our stay. The best accomodation I have experianced in years I recommend for everyone.
672103,59274376,2016-01-09,2084661,Adi,The description of the house was spot on - it is a magical manor house. The inside and outside spaces are gorgeous and comfortable and were just perfect for our Cape Town holiday. Our kids loved the pool  the chickens and fresh eggs  and the various rope swings  while we loved looking at the mountains while grilling on the back patio  the comfortable beds  the fully equipped kitchen and awesome bathrooms. The hosts were lovely extremely attentive  detail oriented  and thoughtful. Location was great too 25 minutes outside downtown CapeTown  and close to wineries  beaches  Kirstenbosch  everything really We had a fantastic stay.
672103,123896631,2016-12-31,17082814,Brita,Thank you Lindy with family to let us stay in your home for ten days We rented a Magical House and got a fantastisk personal home Nice garden big pool lots of animals and a lovely kind atmosphere everywhere THANKS
672103,144181082,2017-04-15,91989815,Michael,Marc and Lindy were very good in checking in and helping us get oriented. The house is in a fantastic location for exploring Cape Town  wine region and the beach towns - a little something for everyone. We had a large group with kids and the house and rope swing  big garden and pool was great for after a long day exploring.
672103,226328392,2018-01-10,53162975,Emily,A beautiful house in a beautiful location- absolutely perfect for a family of four with children. Lots of outdoor space for the kids to run free in a fantastic location if you want to explore Cape Town and beyond. Thanks
672103,533779777404836854,2022-01-06,18627387,Goutam,What can I say - 5 stars for the host and the place Amazing
1049807,583871547978932340,2022-03-16,274702851,Nils,all in all a good place to stay  just the check in was a bit chaotic
1049807,667860638521596843,2022-07-10,467981248,Shaheema,Good place  it was just a mission upon arrival to get the keys as we were late due to hectic traffic. No indication of the parking bay  there were just no notification as to where it is  we had to phone to get the wifi password. Had a lot of miscommunication. When we arrived it was loadshedding and the suite was dark  please invest in buying re chargeable light for the convenience of your guests.
675177,103314928,2016-09-21,44673579,Caroline,This is a great apartment. Wonderful views - including Lions Head. The location is perfect for exploring Cape Town. The apartment has everything you can ask for. It's walking distance to several good restaurants and coffee places. You can stroll along the ocean and through parks. Be at the waterfront in minutes. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a very comfortable and safe place to stay in Cape Town.
675177,149613046,2017-05-05,90156303,Rosalind,Fantastic wrap around views of the ocean
675177,157084109,2017-06-02,33697868,Daniel,Jaco's place is wonderful  We loved the views  and it's in a great location.  The unit was just as described  well equipped  and very comfortable.  No complaints at all
675177,160883388,2017-06-16,59819101,Diane,Fantastic views and great location 
675177,200964235,2017-10-07,24174131,Karen,This apartment matches the pictures .  It has magnificent views of the ocean and mountains and lots of natural light.  All the facilities are great and it is close to shops and restaurants.  It enhanced our time in Cape Town
675177,245928491,2018-03-24,27423238,Yvonne,The Penthouse is very central located. Easy walk to Waterfront. Very comfortable furnished. Communication was easy and both Jaco and the rest of the staff was very responsive.
675177,264957325,2018-05-15,119298842,Martin,What a great place Great view Very spacious. Perfect location to explore the city Would definitely bk it again
675177,297673171,2018-07-28,160055683,Jolanda,It is a nice appartment of very high standard and incredible view. Definitely a place to recommend.
675177,328096973,2018-09-25,19569319,Barbara,Jacos apartment was absolutely amazing the views were stunning and the location convenient to V A waterfront and the hop on hop off bus lines. I would love to stay there again but perhaps in a warmer time of year so I could enjoy his patio.
675177,341938960,2018-10-28,185477555,Vimal,Great location
675177,363682489,2018-12-29,26226790,Michael,Jacos place is beautiful and clean with sweeping ocean views and great ocean breezes. Good location to walk to restaurants  ice cream and activities. When we were delayed over 3 hours getting rental car  the agent checking us in was still there for us when we arrived. Even though it was late  she took the time to walk us through all of the info we needed for our stay. A small draw back is the flight of steps from the garage to floor with lift and flight of steps from 4th floor where lift stops to 5th floor where the apartment is located.  Overall- very good stay and would return
675177,420243023,2019-03-06,183528679,Steve,Amazing views  Staying in the room and watching the surf was relaxing and enjoyable
675177,424223437,2019-03-16,154755128,Debra,We spent several days in Cape Town and really loved this beautiful apartment.  We arrived late and our host was there waiting for us with a smile and instructions.  The view was amazing and the apartment clean and inviting.  We enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to return.
675177,474722257,2019-06-23,116752174,Sheena,We refused to stay more than one night after arriving and their being no hot water  only one working heater and no WiFi THEN finding multiple stains on the sheets  pillows  missing lamp bulbs and the floors to be terribly dirty. Jaco refuses to cancel and refund  but we moved anyway because we were not staying in those conditions. Very sad it didnt work out as we were really looking forward to staying at his place. Offered to refund one night but not the rest...which made no sense considering we left after one night hours really since we arrived at 1030pm and left by 9am for our hotel I booked at 2am because I couldnt sleep for being so cold. I do not recommend this property at all. The view isnt worth the modern conveniences that are lacking on the inside. Nicely renovated kitchen though. Too bad we never got to use it.
675177,565898430,2019-11-18,305499417,James,Great location  spacious spot
675177,616231592,2020-03-09,244068450,Stuart,Lovely  spacious apartment with amazing location and views.
675177,460576850276263160,2021-09-27,236908107,Naledi,This beautiful modern apartment that is very well furnished has breathtaking views of the beach from all angles of the apartment. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you will need. The check-in process was very smooth with the ever so friendly Joan. The location is central to the beach  restaurants  Waterfront and much more We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back again soon
675177,593310560788371620,2022-03-29,246127488,Lantana,What a gem The space provided very good value for money  excellent finishes and stunning views. The finishes of the house are very thoughtfully put together  and the location provides easy access to all the places we wanted to visit. Jaco was a very gracious host and well definitely be coming back.
675177,617213844258397406,2022-05-01,50619597,Fahmida,Beautiful apartment  has all that you need. Excellent location with stunning views. The agency that host uses was responsive and very accommodating. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this accommodation
675177,1157154692840131859,2024-05-15,575843088,Andrea Lee,An absolutely gorgeous apartment Wish we could have stayed there longer. Thank you for making our trip one to remember
1049807,683157616060066339,2022-07-31,277671131,Nomzamo,Great place
1049961,18192693,2014-08-23,18436773,Yenan,Rhodora court is a nice apartment.  Pictures make the apartment look much more modern than it actually is  but once you get used to it it is fine as long as your stay is short.  Building is secure but very old.  Afribode was responsive for all requests.  Don't take MTN because the network is very bad inside the apartment.  Vodafone works perfectly. Close to VA Waterfront and all great  spots in Cape Town.
678993,3743619,2013-03-11,4343046,Anne-Marie,A great cottage - well taken care of and well equipped. Great location - a range of restaurants and cafes  nightlife  close to the universityairporttown. Gwen is close at hand should anything be required but is never intrusive. There are small but lovely touches - roses and chocolates on Valentines basic necessities bread  cheese  wine in fridge on my arrival. I'd certainly stay here again.
678993,4760635,2013-05-24,5984224,Charlie,We had a fantastic stay at Bay Leaf Cottage. Gwen is lovely  even providing us with the basic necessities when moving in at first butter  bread  eggs  coffee and tea and was very approachable throughout our stay. The area of Observatory is great - the nearby Lower Main road has many bars  restaurants and shops and is a short cab ride or drive to the Waterfront or centre of Cape Town. The cottage was in pristine condition and Mickey the housemaid keeps it that way to make your stay even more enjoyable. All in all I highly recommend Bay Leaf Cottage - thanks for such a great stay.
1049961,765834831,2021-06-03,38527667,Heidi,Incredible location  and a great space.
678993,8571611,2013-11-05,5005493,Carl Henrik, Bay Leaf Cottage was excelent. The house was clean and comfortable   with a nice outdoor yard with green plants The host was very helpful and we enjoyed our time in the house. Observatory is a couzy and safe part of Cape Town
678993,9514775,2014-01-01,3358620,Eli,What an AMAZING experience. The house is a beautiful home away from home. Gwen is an outstanding host and catered to all my family's needs. Truly an amazing experience. Everything from their arrival till their departure was just perfect. Thank you so much for creating perfect holiday memories

1049961,615703614480783074,2022-04-29,71438753,Meg,Agree with the previous review - the apartment is not as luxurious as the photos make it seem. Clean enough  basic amenities  and in a good location close to all the Seapoint attractions.
1049961,642517788806584834,2022-06-05,95678201,Jana,This was a very cosy and clean place - we loved the fact that it was so centrally located and that it was right across the playpark on the promenade for our 8 year old daughter who joined us on this trip.

1049961,820158048090177711,2023-02-05,112052436,Simon,We had a disappointing experience during our stay at this AirBnB. We were unable to access the apartment and there was no one there to greet us. Furthermore  upon arrival  the room was not ready  and the toilets were not stocked with toilet paper. In addition  it appeared that the bedsheets in the main room had not been replaced  as there was human hair present in the bed.
678993,10369286,2014-02-16,11811141,Pat,It is the million little things - Gwendoline touches - that make your stay at Bay Leaf Cottage so comfortable. First off  a great safe funky location with easy to follow directions to everything provided by the Bay Leaf Handbook. Not one thing missing in the kitchen and house to prevent you from feeling completely at home. Decor very welcoming and homey. A few basic foods found in the fridge including wine Flowers and chocolate showed up for Valentine's Day. My fav - for the bush camper - hot and cold running shower in the back terrace. Hosts and stays do not get better than this
1049961,832414482968505378,2023-02-22,18309596,Michele,Great apartment on the ground floor facing the sea in a wonderful location. Thank you

1049961,851241729417416664,2023-03-20,210849912,Japie,Very nice place. Parking space inside. Ground floor. Maybe there could be a light or two for times when there is load shedding.

678993,11308226,2014-03-29,7106245,Andrew,We had a delightful 7 day stay at the Bay Leaf Cottage.  Loved the location  the house was great  quiet  clean  spacious and had everything we needed  including great wifi.  Gwendoline did a great job coordinating our late night arrival and even wine in the refrigerator waiting for us.
678993,25430548,2015-01-16,8361774,David,We spent 2 month in Bay Leaf Cottage and had a wonderful stay in the apartment. The apartment is located in one of the nicest areas in Cape Town  a quiet and safe place  but with lots of restaurants and good bars in walking distance. Bay Leaf Cottage is equipped with so much heart and love to the detail  you can really feel at home there. Within 2 months we never missed anything. We loved sitting outside in the backyard  having a braai bbq there. Gwen is a wonderful and caring host  we arrived on our first day and the fridge was filled with lovely food. During our stay the apartment was served and cleaned up and coming home felt like coming into beautiful fresh cleaned hotel room. As mentioned above we felt like home and I can absolutely recommend this place for short term and long term stay. Thank you Gwen for making our stay so wonderful and unforgettable.
678993,26239720,2015-02-08,8407673,Emma,Gwen was a wonderful host  she really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The house is excellently equipped  spotlessly clean and cozy. The outside patio area was really great for breakfast and evening meals The location is good for local eateries and public transport. For tourists  the Green Elephant backpackers around the corner runs tours around the Cape  and is a Bazbus stop.
678993,27900336,2015-03-14,28732327,Sara,My stay at Gwen's cottage was great. It is lovely and comfortable. There is parking for small cars inside the gate. My larger rental car was easily parked on the street. The kitchen was well stocked with breakfast foods. Nice shower and comfy bed. Gwen and Wayne were very pleasant  friendly and helpful. The wireless internet was good though it cut out a few times but Gwen is getting it sorted out and let me use the internet at her house when it was out at the cottage. Thanks for a lovely stay
1050007,64935590,2016-03-09,8089361,Anne,The apartment is super nice  has everything you need and a beautiful view.

1050007,158993680,2017-06-09,123556356,Simon,The place is central and close to everything. Lou Ann was available to help and guide anytime. I would recommend the place to anyone looking to experience Capetown and enjoy walking around the gardens and CBD.
1050007,170840385,2017-07-16,67933532,Medeea,The studio looks exactly like in the pictures. It is very well positioned  within walking distance from the main points of attraction. Communication with the host was very good we asked for a heater  because it was very cold  and we got it the same day.
1050007,362362132,2018-12-26,225012151,Elorm,Good apartment  good communication  good location  great value for money

1050007,1086124717173829729,2024-02-07,24732055,Faldelah,Unfortunately the noise from Long Street party street can be heard especially in the weekends.  Otherwise  everything was fine.

678993,41587901,2015-08-08,22903926,Judyie,I thoroughly enjoyed my extended stay at Bay Leaf Cottage. Its a cozy space with charming dcor and is conveniently located in Observatory close to shops  cafs and public transport. Gwen is a lovely host living next door with her family and even with such close proximity she completely respects guests privacy. The beds are super comfy  the kitchen is well-equipped and the deep claw foot tub is a spa in itself. I would happily book Bay Leaf again.
678993,54503830,2015-11-21,26974348,Jeff,Bay Leaf Cottage was very clean  quiet and perfect for the three of us. We used the full kitchen for breakfast  but ate out our other meals. The beds were very comfortable. I loved the outdoor shower in the private back patio area. Gwen provided us some goodies  including a bottle of wine to welcome us. She lives next door and checked in with us during the week. Picking up and dropping off the key was very convenient. This was our very first Airbnb and we are now hooked.
678993,60945445,2016-01-30,22903926,Judyie,This was my second stay at Bay Leaf Cottage and once again it was a truly lovely visit. With hot summer weather the courtyard is such a pleasure. Thanks Gwen for your gracious hospitality
678993,75573027,2016-05-22,12061837,Shauna,The listing is exactly as described  very secure 2-bedroom ranch-style house. Gwen welcomed us on our arrival and left us some basic groceries  a bottle of wine  and hair care products which was much appreciated We stayed for about 4 weeks and it was an effortless stay. The kitchen is equipped with everything we needed as well. The house was kept very clean the entire time we were there. The location was very convenient to Groote Schuur Hospital  and there are multiple supermarkets within 5 minutes walking distance.
678993,98729343,2016-09-01,68160462,Lauren,Gwen was a great host The place was an amazing place to stay and in a great area
678993,131855553,2017-02-14,86285170,Libby And Jim,Our first AirBNB experience was a huge success thanks to Gwen and the Bay Leaf Cottage. Gwen has thought of everything for a comfortable stay  from the thoroughly equipped kitchen  to high quality linens  beach towels  a cooler  and little things you might need. The cottage is very secure  including a secure parking spot for a small car and a private back patio where we enjoyed our breakfasts. We were lucky to stay for a month and loved the central Obs location  so convenient for our many trips sightseeing in town  to the Winelands  to area golf clubs and more. There are many fun restaurants and cafes right in Obs  and so convenient to the Saturday market and hip dining spots in Woodstock. Gwen's weekly housekeeper was also appreciated. Gwen and her husband are so helpful but never intrusive. We hope to return soon
678993,206565996,2017-10-26,88434184,Veronique,I stayed at Gwen's place for a month after living in Cape Town this year and I cannot give enough compliments. Gwen was SO helpful  kind  happy to answer questions  and extremely flexible and welcoming despite my ever changing schedule Gwen provided to me much more than an Airbnb host should ever have to The house was beautiful  comfortable  safe  clean and well equipped. Gwen was beyond kind  even when I changed plans or called her with extra queries more than once  which I'm sure was frustrating. By far the best Airbnb host I could imagine and a perfect end to my stay in Cape Town. I strongly recommend the cottage also for its location  outdoor living spaces  and security. Thank you Gwen
678993,216845171,2017-12-06,87136488,Daniel,We have recently returned from a one month stay in this lovely cottage. It is really well equipped  with everything one could possibly want in a holiday home  and is situated in a quiet street in the quirky and bohemian area of Observatory. Gwen  the owner of the cottage  lives next door and was always on hand to answer any queries we had. Our stay went all too quickly and we were very sad to leave.
678993,227790069,2018-01-16,26468527,Wolf,After 31 days in Bay Leaf Cottage in Observatory near Groote Schuur Hospital we felt like genuine Capetonians leaving their home. Our home was large for only two persons 2 bedrooms with a guaranteed parking space in front of the house or even behind the gate on the premises. A pleasant sheltered and private back garden with table  chairs  parasol was perfect for breakfast and evening meals. Observatory has the perfect location to get everywhere in Cape Town or surroundings within the shortest time possible. Observatory itself with its unique venues is worth  a visit. The kitchen demands a special comment as it is superbly equipped with utensils and provisions.
678993,348759336,2018-11-15,8145215,Veljko,This is the best equipped AirBNB rental I've ever been to The home will essentially make you feel like at home Besides that  the location is perfect for visiting UCT scholars  while very close to a very vibrant Observatory Lower Main rd.
678993,359576379,2018-12-17,215246753,Shane,Wonderful venue. Met our expectations and more. Nice touch having a few items in the fridge when we checked in.
678993,363181144,2018-12-28,9159915,Jacquelyn,Gwendoline effortlessly achieves super hostess status in my opinion. Apart from the accurate description on the website  she offers so much more in the way of thoughtful touches. It was unnecessary for us to spend our holiday getting started in Bay Leaf Cottage as all of the essentials and much more besides was insightfully and generously gifted by Gwendoline.
678993,367545705,2019-01-05,78263240,Liz,The cottage was bigger and had more privacy than we expected. Our host provided milk  eggs  cheese  bread  and butter upon our arrival  as well as a bottle of wine. The location is terrific  just a very safe couple of blocks walk to coffee  cafes  and shopping. The kitchen is well stocked  with plenty of cookware  gadgets  every kind of glassware  and tea and coffee. Most important  Gwen was very responsive both prior to and during our visit. We will very likely stay here again.
1058642,57587024,2015-12-27,20411133,Michael,One thing upfront MJ and Emma were the best hosts ever. They made us feel welcome and at home welcome at any time.

The house is awesome  great location  wide and charming  rooms  completed furnished as described in the website. In addition there is a really professional concierge service  who helped us to arrange an amazing wine tour. We strongly recommend this accommodation.
1058642,60567644,2016-01-25,7212413,Saskia,Very beautiful guesthouse on private premises  but with your own privacy  centrally located in Camps Bay up the hill. Everything is clean and beautiful  the house has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms  the latter is very convenient and practical. The kitchen is fully equipped  you will find everything from a wine cooler to a toaster and various coffee makers There is room to park your car in front of the house.

1058642,62067030,2016-02-11,47358107,Barry,We had an amazing stay at The Camps Bay Guesthouse.

She kept in good contact and helped us navigate our way through some new to the city mistakes we made. Obs or Observatory has some great restaurants. My family and I would highly recommend staying here.
678993,503581041,2019-08-06,16369351,Torsten,Bay Leaf Cottage was very conveniently situated for us family with two kids to explore CapeTown. Gwen's place ist great  she was a super host and we can just recommend it

1058642,64516219,2016-03-05,16658739,Laura,The apartment was perfect for what we wanted-a short walk down to camps bay and drive into town. It was huge so plenty of space for us to spread out. The only thing that would've made it better would having a private pool
1058642,65255676,2016-03-12,59861322,Charmian,We could not have asked for a better  more friendly and helpful host. From the moment I placed my booking up to our departure  Mj made our stay at CPT a truly delightful and memorable experience This property is very modern and beautiful - and located right in the heart of the posh and renowned Camps Bay.
1058642,67868328,2016-04-01,35569987,Kate,I can't say enough wonderful things about our stay here Not only was the guest house spacious  beautiful  well-stocked  and super convenient 10 min walk down the hill to all the restaurants  bars  shops  but the hosts could not have been more welcoming and helpful. Michaeljon and Emma went above and beyond in ensuring we were comfortable and situated with all our needs  both ahead of time and during our stay. We were traveling with a young baby and they'd gone so far as to set us up with a sleeper  toys  play mat  and baby toiletries when we arrived It made our travel experience so much easier and more enjoyable. We highly recommend this home and will hopefully be returning again soon
1058642,69166734,2016-04-09,14264028,Kim,Emma and Michealjon were fantastic hosts - hospitable and welcoming. The house was absolutely beautiful and perfectly located. We can't recommend highly enough
1058642,79511082,2016-06-13,48331702,Clive,We needed to make it over to Cape Town for some business and were tired of staying in hotels so we tried MichaelJon's place in Camps Bay. Wow  what a lovely apartment in such a beautiful place. The place was clean and tidy and MichaelJon was a great host.  I hope to get back again another time.
1058642,107930367,2016-10-13,1443914,Marco,We had a great stay at Emmas and Michaeljons guesthouse. The guesthouse was extemely clean and very spacious. Emma and Michaeljon were wonderful hosts  they really made us feel at home. Thanks again
1058642,120843881,2016-12-12,46237450,David,Host is amazing and very accommodating. Bedding and bathrooms are super.
1058642,121196592,2016-12-15,87428033,Cristina,Ideal accommodation in Camps Bay. A short walk to the beachfront. Michaeljon could not have been kinder  and went far beyond what was needed by providing everything for our small baby as well. The flat has two great bedrooms  and is very clean and modern with a clever layout. You feel safe and calm - great after the bustle of Camps Bay. I would highly recommend staying here.
1058642,125120568,2017-01-04,8052059,Diane,We stayed at the apartment for 4 days and had a great time Thank you Michealjon for the hospitality and kindness. If possible we will definitely come back. Kind regards from Holland

1058642,130037396,2017-02-04,47690565,Jakob,Already at the time of booking we knew that we were in good hands  and that good feel continued all the way through until the last day when we checked out. MJ was absolutely fantastic and had arranged for 2 baby cots for our 2 little girls. The place itself is only 700 m from the beautiful beach of camps bay. And if there was anything to complain about...and it's not really a complaint  it would be that me missed a dishwasher and washing Maschine a bit  but that's about it  can highly recommend this place to everyone out there.
1058642,132641595,2017-02-18,57084211,Alan,We had a fantastic stay here...Michaeljon and Emma are the perfect hosts...they couldn't have done enough for us We will definitely be back

1058642,134111639,2017-02-26,9407515,Laura,We stayed at Michaeljons apartment for two nights at the end of our holiday to SA. The apartment didn't let us down It is beautiful inside and has a lovely little view of the sea from the back bedroom. The apartment has great security and is in a really lovely area of Cape Town. The beach is just a 510 minute walk where you will find a lovely strip of nice bars and restaurants. Michealjon greeted us both and was very accomidating  recommending some great places to eat Had a great time and would defiantly stay again

The guest house was beautifully presented  modern and clean. We had everything we needed for our 6 night stay and Michaeljon was on hand for anything needed. The description on Airbnb was extremely accurate and we were delighted on out arrival. I would highly recommend this guest house to anyone wanting to stay and experience Camps Bay

1058642,144270656,2017-04-15,112388919,Marc,Well located apartmenthome. Top quality finishes. A great base from which to explore the spoils at Camps Bay  Table Mountain and the Water Front. Quick and easy access to Chapmans Peaks Drive. We enjoyed our stay albeit for one night only. Most of our time was spent exploring and very little time spent at the home  but I can highly recommend this home as an ideal base for your vacation.
1058642,146029307,2017-04-21,1375650,Andrew,Michaeljon is incredibly responsive  accommodating. His place is very spacious and is centrally located. We absolutely loved every minute of our stay and hope to visit again as soon as we can.

1058642,148747194,2017-05-01,125935773,Arjun,Had an absolutely fabulous time at Michaeljons Airbnb. We were welcomed by Michaeljon and his lovely son. The place is a beautiful 2 bedroom apartment with a lot of living space beautifully decorated Very near Camps Bay beach although given the size of Cape Town I do recommend you rent a car.  Going back for sure
1058642,150616580,2017-05-08,5980547,Marcus,Michealjon and his family are perfect hosts and the apartment is awesome. We enjoyed our stay very much and wish them all the best for the future.

1058642,163002872,2017-06-23,3344637,J,Everything was as pictured and Michaeljon was a superb host. He went above and beyond to accommodate us during our stay. The home is in a quiet neighborhood very near to the beautiful Camps Bay beaches and great restaurants. It was very easy to find from the airport  spacious and nicely decorated with all the amenities you would need for a home away from home experience. We had a great stay at Michaeljon's place and hope to be back soon.
1058642,167952774,2017-07-08,6544199,Julian Marcus,I can't say enough great things about Michaeljon  his home.  First off  his home has a great central location in Camps Bay. You're within walking distance from the beach and a short Uber ride away from both Table Mountain  Lion's Head.  His home has beautiful modern design with tons of space  natural light.  Michaeljon's communication before and during the trip was awesome.  He helped us setup a local tour of the Cape of Good Hope and helped us retrieve our lost luggage.  I would definitely recommend staying with him on any trips to Cape Town
1058642,177914621,2017-08-04,8513227,Mindy,Please trust that this is the best place to spend a week in Cape Town As a single lady this home provided modern  aesthetics which afforded a beautiful and peaceful experience after long hikes and adventures in this city and around. I felt safe and happy every day as I walked to the mountain or beach eateries. The host family and care takers of the property are the kind and super hosts indeed. You will have no regrets in booking your stay here
1058642,183739485,2017-08-18,65288870,Kyle,Would definitely recommend Michaeljon's guesthouse. The place was very clean and welcoming  and even looked better than the pictures. Just a few minutes walk from Camps Bay  short drive to the downtown area.

678993,617875591103972233,2022-05-02,222825565,Danielle,Lovely  spotlessly clean Victorian cottage  perfectly situated quiet street  but short walking distance to Observatory main road and its shops and restaurants. The bedrooms offer plenty of cupboard space  and the electric blanket in the comfy bed was a bonus at the change of season The kitchen contains all the essentials  and more  which was ideal for our 3-weeks stay. We made good use of the pleasant  sunny courtyard  and the safe parking space was a great bonus in Obs. Gwen is a friendly and responsive host  who attended quickly to any queries. We will definitely be back
678993,683902907114608631,2022-08-01,115107763,Danielle,This is our second stay at Bay Leaf cottage  and it now feels like a second home. As remarked after our first visit  the cottage is  very well set up the electric blanket so welcome on the cold winter nights and offers a secure parking space  a bonus in Observatory. It is within easy walking distance from shops and restaurants  although in a quiet street.  Gwendoline is a great communicator and a thoughtful hostess. We'll definitely be back 
678993,753415178068342114,2022-11-05,163533230,Quinn,Gwendoline's place is great It is an old house but very clean and well-kept  with all necessary amenities. It is well located on a quiet street in the characterful suburb of Observatory  a short drive from the city centre and Cape Town's various tourist attractions. We travelled for business  but I can highly recommend her place for all types of stays.
678993,765788270942546666,2022-11-22,115107763,Danielle,This is a lovely  fully-equipped and perfectly kept cottage in one of the quietest street in Observatory  yet within easy walking distance of all the restaurants and shops in the area.

And I wouldn't have known to come to Obs  but what a delightful little neighborhood Great shopping vibes  killer pizza Ferdinando's - felt very homey. Thank you  Gwendoline
678993,797585982274129215,2023-01-05,182906208,Sherryl,We had a lovely stay The house is very old  so the plumbing reflects that  but we could not fault how well appointed Gwens place was. We had absolutely everything we needed for a very comfortable and enjoyable stay.
678993,810656273647244417,2023-01-23,42269917,David,Gwen's place is just perfect and even way better than the pictures imply. The outdoor shower is a particular unexpected delight

1058642,242531815,2018-03-12,26863917,Wallis,Worth each  every five stars  starting with prompt responses  friendly communication  and an easy check-in. MJ gave us great recommendations for CT.

1058642,245170062,2018-03-21,114176412,Maryanne,Michaeljon was a wonderful host who ensured that our stay was simply amazing He took great care of us and made us feel at home from the moment we arrived with his warmth  generosity and attention to detail. The guesthouse is beautifully designed and perfectly located within walking distance from the beach and numerous restaurants... It was a memorable stay and we look forward to being back-
1058642,250784545,2018-04-06,129377521,Alex,This is a great  safe guesthouse that is within short walking distance of the heart of Camp's Bay. We did not arrive until after 11pm on a Sunday and MJ was there waiting for us. He was very thoughtful in providing some necessities for our 1-year old as well as some other items for our family that were beyond our expectation. We would definitely stay here again
1058642,255722170,2018-04-21,13679474,Victor,Super stay - Super host - could not ask for more - Many Thx
1058642,260209546,2018-05-04,52287734,Tracie,.
1058642,264164715,2018-05-13,9751081,David,Michaeljon's home was absolutely fantastic. He welcomed us into his family home with open arms. The place is well designed  with quality furniture  a great attention to detail and overall amazingly good vibe. A couple minutes from the beach  a 5 minute drive to CT center. There is nothing negative I could say about our time there... As a frequent traveller to South Africa  I think I've found my new home away from home  I could not recommend MJ's place more thoroughly
1058642,275626004,2018-06-11,147164781,Paul,I can not emphasise enough what a wonderful host Michaeljon and his wonderful family were during my stay in Cape Town - such warm  welcoming  and accommodating people. I look forward to my next visit and highly recommend this space for anyone's visit to Cape Town - an ideal location and setting to explore the beauty that Cape Town has to offer  with spacious comfortable rooms and all the amenities anyone could ask for.
1058642,278941658,2018-06-19,34285064,Dominic,Beautiful apartment  spacious and stylish. Lovely and quiet but close enough to camps bay and just over Kloof Nek to all the restaurants and so on there. Michaeljon was very quick to respond and helped us out whenever we needed something. Highly recommended.
1058642,284919970,2018-07-02,88529703,Katrina,Beautiful place to stay and a wonderful host. This guesthouse has nice views of the mountains and beach  and is a short 10 minute walk to the local beach and restaurants. The home has a modern feel and comfy beds. This place is a short drive to various attractions in Capetown. The host is friendly and responds quickly. We would definitely stay here again.
1058642,289921256,2018-07-13,188464334,Nikita,Mj was an awesome host and his place was just as amazing  so modern and spacious. We were so sad to leave but hope to definitely be back again. Thank you Mj  for your friendliness and hospitality. Much love from Ali and i
1058642,299507871,2018-07-31,76143762,Rick,Very nice neighborhood and guest house.    Michaeljon and family were fun and helpful.   We walked to the beach area often and even over to and up Lion's Head for a longer hike.   Michaeljon was very clear about the water situation - we two of us had lots of water remaining each day.   No issues at all.
1058642,304245624,2018-08-09,45508839,Josie,From the moment we arrived we felt right at home.  MJ is so lovely and warm and whilst the apartment is on site of their home it is very private and we hardly saw each other but he was quick to respond if we asked for his advice on CT stuff. The apartment is gorgeous and spacious - I dont think the photos do it justice. And the beds were to die for. Security is key in CT and MJs place is very secure. He has on site secure parking. I absolutely loved staying in Camps Bay and MJs  Highly recommend. Thanks MJ for such an amazing stay. Ill be back
1058642,313308649,2018-08-25,26905252,Phillip,What can I say MJ's house is impeccable. As a host he was one of the most resourceful people I have ever met. I asked him about his soft linens one day and he wrote a whole email on where they came from and I went on to purchase them...this is how hospitality is done
686495,29774616,2015-04-12,21045571,Camille,Odette's house is beautiful  very clean  secured  and furnished with a lot of taste. The kitchen is very well equipped and there is a wonderful terrass with amazing sunsets  The garden is big with lots of beautiful flowers and trees  the pool is great and big enough to swim. We spent five beautiful days and the only hard part was to leave The house is very well located  five minutes walk from a lovely little beach and 10 minutes walk from Camps Bay beach  restaurants  coffe shops  grocery shops etc. Bus stop is two minutes walk from the house and takes you everywhere in Cape Town I felt so privileged to stay in odette's house. It's also furnished with a lot of taste  all rooms are pretty  beds and sofas are very comfortable   and there are flowers evrywhere She welcomes us with her family in a very warm way  there was homemade bread cooking  in the oven and a bottle of excellent white wine in the fridge  The family even let us use their bus cards during our stay. I really recommend Odette's house and I would love to go back again Many thanks for everything Odette We had wonderful holidays -
686495,66425268,2016-03-22,41527798,Kim,Odette and family welcomed us in their artistic and charming house with a homemade bread The house is perfectly located to explore the Cape and a nice stroll away from the lively boulevard of Camps Bay.  We really felt at home  enjoyed the sunset from the veranda and were sad to leave We would definitely like to come back
686495,440790840,2019-04-21,180079764,Redi,Odette is a warm  gracious and generous host. Her lovely home is welcoming  spacious and close to shops and restaurants.  The views from every part of the house are spectacular. One does not really need a car when staying there as shops  restaurants and the beach are a stone's throw away. The house is located on a sharp curve and negotiating the driving in and out can be tricky so it is best to just walk everywhere because you get to experience the beauty of the suburb  whilst feasting your eyes on glorious views.  Odette's house has all the conveniences of modern living and staying in doors was just as enjoyable as a night out.  It was truly value for money.
686495,583728369,2019-12-29,314622676,Lisa-,Our family with small babies had lovely space in a warm family style home. The hosts were gracious and kind and our family had a very enjoyable stay  close to Bakoven beach
686495,588850713,2020-01-05,42996444,Jamie,Great spot and lovely place with great garden
686495,533076326612128353,2022-01-05,99501318,Clair,The location is great. The house does need some few modern upgrades to compete with a lot of the offerings in Capetown. The lack of blackout curtains in the Master bedroom made sleeping in an impossible task so we were up at 5.30 a.m with the sunrise summertime. The outside space is not child friendly as there is a steep drop from the terrace and no guard rail so if you travel with small kids  you will have to constantly supervise them when outside. Wifi is available but the connectivity is almost zero in the master bedroom so we used up lots of data when in the Bedroom. It does have its charms so with a few touch ups it can offer a quaint homestay.
1058642,322772414,2018-09-14,162543076,James,Great accommodation and host. Felt safe  plenty of good recommendations of things to do  places to go.

1058642,346935554,2018-11-10,31149687,Tracy,Mjs guest house was a lovely place to stay in Camps Bay. Close to the beach  close to the city and a short drive from the airport. The place was clean and tidy and felt very safe. The beds were very comfortable and water shortage was really not a problem. Mj was an excellent host. He catered well for us and our 11 month old son. Provided a cot  high chair  changing facilities and he even baby-proofed the electric sockets.  He replied quickly to all our questions both before and during our stay. Really recommend Mjs place. To thumbs up 
1058642,349081215,2018-11-16,66615415,Stuart,This place is perfect in everyway. You will not be disappointed

The place is recently remodeled and very stylish and comfy. Michaeljon couldn't have been more welcoming.

688644,9632122,2014-01-04,6015700,Nomsa,We stayed here after staying at the Loft and loved this one even more. Probably because it was a little less fancy than the Loft but still a beautiful and very cozy cottage  we felt very much at home.

She is just off Kloof street  my favorite part of Cape Town... plenty of bars and restaurants and under 10minute taxi ride to the beach To top it all off there is a pool with mountain views to cool you down. I searched hight and low for a place like hers and delighted I found it.
688644,10586485,2014-02-26,10825739,Stephanie,Erzhle anderen in der Airbnb-Gemeinschaft von Deinem Aufenthalt.

688644,23654219,2014-12-07,1814652,Nick,Doreen is a delightful hostess.  Glass of wine  bread  cheese provided when we checked in - and always available with help and guidance as needed.  The cottage is simple and in very good taste  great for a couple.  Glorious view of Table Mountain from the garden.  Access to the swimming pool and covered table by the barbecue pit.  Room cleaned daily.  Good location - just steps away from fashionable Kloof Street - bakery  cafes  boutiques  great restaurants  and walking distance to downtown.  Easy access by car to Camps Bay and Clifton beaches.  Two sweet and loving dogs roam freely in the garden. All good.
688644,24908771,2015-01-04,5376792,Steffi,Dorrens Home felt like a Second home in Capetown  it was Perfect The Olives Cottage with it's calm Atmosphere  the beautiful property  clean  stylish and in a vibrant neighborhood - Doreen and Meyer recommended Amazing places and have been so helpful and friendly to us We will come back -
688644,26243265,2015-02-08,7481212,Anja,Doreen was such a nice host. If we needed something we could just have a look in the kitchen  because there was always somebody who could help us. We felt so welcome and comfortable in Doreen's cottage with the beautiful garden around it. It was also so nice to have a tasty  fresh breakfast on the terrace  which was made by Doreen's daughter. The cottage was furnished and decorated so lovely and creative what we really liked. We had a really nice time there and we will definitely come back
688644,27255493,2015-03-01,25743273,Daniel,We loved staying at this very special place First of all the whole property is amazing and has such a beautiful green garden. We felt like if we stayed in the property for a day it would have felt like being in the countryside instead of the city. Everything is so green  there are birds and its very quiet. That is a funny thing because if you leave the house you will see that its located in one of the hottest areas in Cape Town. The Kloof St is really cool  it has plenty super good restaurants and cafs. We went there for dinner a lot and loved the Kloof Street House. The Long Street  Bree Street are also fun for going out in the evenings and we enjoyed that Olive's Cottage was so close to everything. Beside the location  the house and especially the cottage we stayed in were beautiful The interior is just so special and delicate. You can tell that Doreen has a extraordinary taste in design. I would describe it as a mix between relaxed countryside elegance meeting modern scandinavian design. But you can notice the SA influence aswell everywhere which we liked a lot. We loved this creative and special interior Doreen's family is just lovely. They made us feel at home and welcome in the very second. The dog and cats who came by from time to time sweetened every day for us. Her husband gave us some great advice for the garden route  The staff was also extremely polite and always helpful. Thanks so much to Robert for helping us and to his lovely wife for the laundry. Special thanks aswell to Doreen's daughter who caters the cottages. We never and i mean never had such a good and healthy breakfast Fresh juice with ginger  fruits  eggs  pancakes  bakon  beans ect. - everything you could ask for in the best qualtity. For me one of the definite highlights of our trip And she was very nice too  and at last but not least Doreen herself - she is the perfect host. We felt so comfortable and welcome. Thank you so much She welcomed us with wine  ham and olives and was present everyday  So as you can see it was the perfect stay and we will definetely come back
688644,27831084,2015-03-13,9851645,Annie,We had a wonderful stay at Olive's Cottage.  We were greeted with a board of ham  cheese and bread and a cold beer  what could be better after a long flight  The cottage was great  a lovely light  airy bedroom and big bathroom.  Although there were other guests at the property we felt like we had the place to ourselves a lot of the time.  The staff were very helpful  even preparing a barbecue sorry  braai for us and one night and clearing it all away before we had got up in the morning.  We will definitely be back for another stay  if my boyfriend had his way it would be next week
688644,28999571,2015-04-02,1496770,Jacki,Wonderful. Just wonderful. This property is a beautiful sanctuary and I truly have nothing negative to say.

We werden ontvangen met heerlijke wijn van het huis en lekkere hapjes. De cottage is onderdeel van een mooie woning in n van de fijnste wijken van Kaapstad. Echt een uitvalsbasis voor de rest van de stad. Meyer heeft ons voorzien van heel veel leuke tips voor Kaapstad en de Garden Route. Dit is precies waarvoor je via AirBnB boekt Komen hier in de toekomst zeker weer.

Convenient to get to from the airport via Uber  and literally a 10 minute walk down the hill to the beachamazing restaurants  it truly is a great place to stay.

The location is a 10 min stroll downhill to the promenade and a cheap Uber back up.

Would highly recommend.

They are superb at giving you your own space while at the same time ensuring they are always ready with advice and good conversation. They even invited us out with some of their friends which was a really nice way to meet more new people. This was our first time using Airbnb and we were a little bit nervous about how it would be but it was incredible  simply because Tom and Grazia were so cool. They made our amazing stay in Cape Town that much better.

As their preview states  their home is close to transport so that I could travel into the harbour and if I wanted to catch a taxi back it only cost 100 rand.  Every day I would get on the 'jump on  jump off' bus which covered most of Cape Town.  I also rented a car which was quite cheap from around the corner from the Herbstein home to drive to the Cape.  Wonderful  I would highly recommend staying with Tom  Grazia and Charly the cat.  It is quite comical to hear Charly run down the passage way to her food   Thanks to you all.

The area has lots of nice cafes  bars and restaurants and is only 10 minutes drive from the city centre. A great location. Tom and Grazia made us feel very welcome and we would certainly stay with them again in the future 
690609,9897356,2014-01-18,4039212,Paola,Tom  Grazia are very friendly and pleasant hosts  and the house is sunny  clean  elegant... all together we really enjoyed our stay. Anybody looking for a comfortable place to stay in Cape Town  fairly near to the centre and not at all expensive  this is it

Tom and Grazia were so helpful with recommendations of things to do and places to eat. We immediately felt welcome and comfortable in their home.  The location is fantastic as well.  Plenty to do right in the area and a quick cab ride to anywhere else you may want to go in Cape Town.  We will be staying here again the next time we visit Cape Town
690609,20546997,2014-10-01,15797746,Lena,The description of the house was very accurate and the hosts so friendly and helpful. I really couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The neighbourhood is in a good location  it's easy to get to both the city centre as well as the UCT. My room was very comfortable and spacious. Tom and Grazia are the best possible hosts and my stay in Cape Town wouldn't have been the same without them.

I can highly recommend exploring Camps bay and booking Mjs place as it is a short walk away from the beach and we felt very safe. Working from the apartment was also seamless as the internet speed is more than sufficient for video calls.
1058642,1075926511646853603,2024-01-24,16615495,Nicolas,Wir hatten eine super Zeit mit unserer kleinen Tochter. MJ war super freundlich und hat uns viele Tipps gegeben. Die Unterkunft liegt super und entspricht den Fotos. Wir kommen gerne wieder.

Additionally  MJ gave us top notch recommendations - restaurants  coffee  sites  etc. Could not recommend staying with MJ more. The guest house was beautiful and we felt incredibly safe. I hope to stay there again in the future
1058642,1090498905244476511,2024-02-13,367450654,Michael,We had a wonderful time staying here  it had absolutely everything we needed and more. The property is extremely child friendly  lovely and spacious and private. We felt very secure and the location was spot on. Michaeljon is a fantastic host  super helpful and being local he knew everything you need to know. He had so many great recommendations for restaurants. I highly recommend staying here.
1058642,1094101445680256930,2024-02-18,390002314,Eric,My wife and I stayed at Michealjons guest house for a few days during our honeymoon in Cape Town. Our stay was absolutely great The space was clean  modern  and in a great location in Camps Bay. Michealjon was extremely accommodating  enthusiastic  and also had a great recommendations for seemingly anywhere in the city. Highly recommend a stay here  it will not disappoint
1058642,1097749607768431797,2024-02-23,30912941,Christopher,Wonderful host and incredible location. The accommodation is contemporary and funky.
690609,22644365,2014-11-11,18083508,Martin,Tom and Grazia made me feel welcomed immediately  showing me how everything worked and helped me get started by taking me to the supermarket. I was staying with them for five weeks alone and everytime they were doing something they invited me to join which was super nice being in Cape town alone and without a car. The description on their page and pictures are exactly what it looks like except from that they just got an adorable puppy  Roxy The area feels safe walking in daylight and going to the bar and restaurant street in the evening. They are really good at recommending what to do and where to eat and that made my stay a lot better than being in a hotel. When my boyfriend arrived after five weeks they charged the same for the room and every time we wanted to do something they borrowed us towels for the beach  maps for hiking and other stuff. It felt like staying with old friends  but you also had your privacy in a lovely room and was not expected to be super social all the time.  I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely stay with them again when I come to Cape Town and will recommend it to all my friends
690609,26243337,2015-02-08,13401545,Megir,Me and my girlfriend stayed for 6 weeks with tom and grazia. The room is in Observatory and is situated close to most places to visit in cape town. There are gas stations and supermarkets close to their home. The placehouse is safe  since it has the standard security most houses have in cape town Observatory. Tom and Grazia always tried their best to help us where to go and visit interesting places around cape town and south africa. They both know a lot and have experience about traveling around cape town and southern africa. The house is cleaned once a week by a cleaning woman. Its also possible to let her clean the room as well. The internet has a moderate speed 5mbits  which should be enough in most cases. There is enough space in the fridge and in the kitchen for personal stuff. The kitchen is big enough  so a couple of people can prepare their food. The house is also close to the Groote Schuur Hospital. Outside  it should be possible to park your own car rented car. Keep in mind that one still needs to be careful like most places in cape town south africa two of my hubcaps from rented car got stolen during a night within one week. We could join Tom and Grazia to go on a wonderful hike up the Devils Peak  which was great and we were very grateful to be with local people. They are also members of a local running club and participated in several running events  which you could join as well. The running events were great and its also good to get to know other people from cape town. They have a young dog and a cat. The cat is very calm. The young dog can be very energetic  but if you like dogs  you will have fun. The dog is trained to behave properly and will not enter your room. The house is very beautiful and inside it looks very interesting. The room is very high  so it doesn't get very warm during the summer  which was great The bathroom is very clean and beautiful.  We definitely recommend to stay at this place. You will have so much advantages compared to other tourists if you can stay with local people. You will also experience the lifestyle people have in cape town.
690609,26397856,2015-02-11,25265055,Peter,We stayed at Tom and Grazias for four nights. They offered much advise on what to do and where to eat and such. We really enjoyed staying there and felt very much welcome and at home. They have a very adorable pup called Roxy which we also fell in love with. Tom and Grazia is everything AirBnB is about - loads of advise  heaps of personality and a very friendly atmospheric home. We hope to visit again
690609,36058442,2015-06-24,29548162,Louise,Me and my brother had a really great time at this place  the house is spacious with a charming backyard  a big kitchen with every tools you need for cooking  the shower with it walks in rocks  make you think you're in a Ushuaia advertising  very nice  Plus  the neighborhood is calm  and the grocery stores and bars are very close to the house. Grazia and Tom are very nice and flexible  I recommend their place for a stay in Cape Town 
1058642,1103441466021813759,2024-03-02,551110735,Tim,Weve just had a wonderful week at Michaeljons stunning apartment in Camps Bay.

It looks exactly as in the pictures  is a very pleasant complex with plenty amenities and Jenny was a great host.  She was not there herself but communicated frequently and was happy to make recommendations for places to go and things to do as well as checking I was comfortable.  I can only recommend her and the apartment.
1075794,16710239,2014-08-01,4905063,Robyn  Greg,We had a fabulous stay in Jenny's apartment The apartment is exactly as-advertised clean  modern  secure  well-equipped and conveniently located.

690609,52492880,2015-10-30,27050369,Katrin,Grazia was a wonderful host. We stayed in her appartment for one week and we really enjoyed it. We even had the chance to have dinner with Grazia and some of her friends which was also really nice. The apartment is just as beautiful as it looks on the pictures and equipped with everything you might need. The best part of it definitely is the patio where you can sit and have breakfast or simply just enjoy the good weather. We'd definitely recommend this airbnb

690609,83129488,2016-07-01,22295467,Swati,Grazia was incredibly kind and welcoming She was easy to get in contact with prior to my trip and answered my many questions quickly. She wasn't there when I arrived  but provided her friend's number who met me at the house and gave me all the info I needed. The house is lovely  as is Obz  and Grazia and her friends gave such good advice and were so fun and easy to talk to.

When we arrived we were immediately made to feel very welcome  Tom made sure to explain everything before everyone headed off into the night. Unfortunately we didn't get the chance to speak often because everyone was so busy it was the weekend after all but when we did get the chance we had very interesting conversations. The location is very close to Obs Main Street which is a good place to grab a drink I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arises
690609,120022805,2016-12-07,76269534,Emelie,Grazia var mycket tillmtesgende och hrde av sig med jmna mellanrum fr att kolla hur jag hade det. Hon hade lmnat guidebok och kartor och det var superbra med tips p restauranger och butiker. Vldigt trevligt hus med larm och gott om sngklder  handdukar mm. Tyvrr var det inte s bra ventilation i ppna spisen s den anvnde jag bara en gng och s drog det in rtt mycket nr det blser men s r det i de flesta hus i Kapstaden. Vlutrustat kk och generst att det fanns olivolja  kryddor mm i skpen. Tryggt med larm men som gick av ett par gnger utan att det var klart varfr men d stod Grazia och jag i kontakt och det kndes tryggt. Ett supertrevligt boende och vldigt mysigt med liten innergrd och ljust vardagsrum i omrde med mycket kafer och nra till matvarubutik och kommunikationer.  Skulle absolut rekommendera andra att bo i detta fina boende
690609,124083298,2017-01-01,4204327,Taylor,Had a lovely stay at Grazia's place. She was very easy to get ahold of and super responsive. The place itself is quite large  very good wifi  well equipped kitchen. Close to Metro Rail so it's very easy to get to Simons Town and Boulders' Beach. It takes about 15 minutes by car to get downtown - I'd say that's the only downside.
690609,125487071,2017-01-06,97924663,Sofia,This place was really good for a week in Cape Town. We had a car to be able to see the city  which was a good thing because it was a couple of minutes away from the city center. But everything was amazing and the house was nice  roomy and comfortable
690609,126106626,2017-01-09,65725078,Scott,Grazia is a great host and we felt welcome the minute we arrived. The house is better than in the photos and is very open and spacious. The bedrooms  lounge  kitchen  and bathroom were all met with happiness from my friends and I. The location is amazing and is 15 min from the city  airport  and the waterfront. No complaints  no issues  better than we expected. We will definitely attempt to book this place when we visit Cape Town again
690609,127966305,2017-01-22,52162663,Elle,Nice old House in Observatory. Not hysterically clean but with a very nice and caretaking host. They fully understood my problems with perfume allergi and acted very responsibly to that. Thanks for a lovely two weeks stay.
690609,148556099,2017-05-01,3700877,BethAnne,We stayed one month in this great little house in Observatory. We loved the open spaces  the kitchen with everything you need for cooking  the luxury of cleaning service  and the wonderful small courtyard in the back. Also  lots of good books and tourist info. Grazia was both friendly and generous  helping us out with small extras like an early check-in and an air mattress for a guest who did not want to sleep on the sofa. There are many grocery stores  cafs and restaurants in the area within walking distance. The list of tips provided was very useful. We were two colleagues sharing the house whilst working at UWC and the location was good  although we did require a car. A car is a must for staying in Obs. In general  the area felt quite safe for us  as well as very quiet at night. We felt like we stayed at a friend's house.
690609,156620070,2017-05-31,128051037,Leah,Super cozy  quaint  and convenient for us  with all conveniences at hand. The spaciousness especially made it very good value. Will certainly stay there again.
690609,185304257,2017-08-21,33917383,Abigail,Grazia was very welcoming on arrival.  Her home is really comfortable and interesting with so many interesting artefacts from her and Tom's travels. It was a little cold but soon remedied by lighting the fire. We explored the local area and enjoyed many of the coffee shops on the recommended list. A lovely place to stay
690609,207086439,2017-10-28,15843087,Louise,Really enjoyed the stay. The home is very spacious with 2 very large rooms. Grazia is also very accommodating and made sure everything was in order.
690609,208802712,2017-11-03,155260290,Markus,Awesome place in a perfect location. Super close to everything in Obs.
690609,211935635,2017-11-15,148039511,Peter,Just be aware of not renting too long a car if you want offroad parking
690609,213995452,2017-11-24,397740,Tara,Tom and Grazias place was perfect. Well located in the middle of Observatory  a short walk from lower main road. The house is a good size and well decorated wirh everything we needed. We particularly liked the suntrap back garden.
690609,218128329,2017-12-11,101456541,Seolebaleng Priscilla,Tom and Grazia's place is such a nice and cosy house in a safe environment We honestly got our value for money - the condition and location of the house we very good and a very short driving distance to the attraction spots in Cape Town. They are very good hosts  Thank you Grazia  Thank you Tom
690609,220605777,2017-12-23,11471556,Hatice,The place was good for 4 nights stay. The hosts were accommodating in the arrangements for a 5th person via an additional mattress but we were not informed it would be an inflatable one. They also helped us check in earlier but check out is not really at 10 am as the cleaner arrived already bu 9 am. But all in all it was a positive experience and we enjoyed our stay.
1075794,72392481,2016-05-02,23422545,Johani,My parents-in-law stayed in Jenny's flat for the month of April  and they loved it They felt like locals and raved about the location - everything is walking distance the Waterfront  Long Street  Bo-Kaap... The flat itself is clean  safe and well-equipped. Beautiful view from the patio  and they enjoyed the swimming pool access. Great service from the cleaning staff that came in once a week. Great restaurants in the area and grocery shopping at the Spar up the street was very convenient. We didn't meet Jenny as she was travelling but had no problems checking in and out with her agent. We highly recommend this flat  and will definitely book again for their next trip Thank you  Jenny
1075794,90037659,2016-07-31,28372077,Maya,Jenny was an amazing host. She consistently answered my questions promptly and with great detail. The apartment itself is awesome and matches the description and pictures. The location is close to many shops  restaurants  and bars. I felt comfortable walking in the streets in the late evening  but used Uber at night. I highly recommend this location
690609,224079895,2018-01-02,3662611,Kathleen,Tom and Grazia were great hosts. Th location is perfect. Just a short walk to lower main which is full of bars and restaurants. The place was clean and comfortable. Perfect for us traveling as two couples. Tom and Grazia were incredibly responsive. They even gave us some grace when one of the keys got lost in our bags We found it and returned it before our flight out of Cape Town. Thank you so much for a great stay in the mother city
690609,231654606,2018-02-02,1503984,Vivian,This flat got more than you could wish for. It' s spacious  clean  superbly  equipped  in a quiet street but really close to some beautiful cafs and thrift shops. We and our little daughter felt instantly at home. You got the terrace and a small frontyard  enough space to spend some time around the house. And if you'd like to to a picnic at Kirstenbosch they even have a cool bag for cold white wine  Plus  Tom and Grazia were exceptionally helpful  if you had any questions or problems  they answered  within minutes. We would come back immediately  and recommend it to everyone. Thank you Grazia and Tom  it was a pleasure.
690609,232765084,2018-02-06,49062794,Julie,We loved Tom and Grazia's house. Grazia was very welcoming  the house is beautiful and bigger than it looks on the photos  the neighborhood is very nice and the location ideal 15 min from the airport. Great qualityprice ratio.
690609,234268380,2018-02-12,65964019,Dennis And Karen,We loved this home and highly recommend it We felt safe in a nice community. The kitchen is so well equipped everything you'd ever want on vacation  We found the bed to be very comfortable. We had a car so didn't need public transportation  but within a block there are loads of buses going by.  As well  a grocery store is with two blocks which makes it so convenient.  We didn't meet Tom  but Grazia is a lovely person and responds with quick communication. Thanks so much Grazia and Tom.
690609,235569635,2018-02-17,11087011,Christiane,Our stay at grazias and toms house was very nice and we felt at home. We stayed there as two friends and it is a spacious and very well styled home. I recommend it highly  And the neighborhood is very interesting- you are into a lot of design shops  cafes and restaurants. See you  Grazia was always in touch and we had a good communication during the time.
690609,239103582,2018-02-28,3001252,Lisa,Wir hatten eine wunderbare Zeit in Gracias Haus. Es ist liebevoll eingerichtet und liegt im schnen Observatory. Uns hat es so gut gefallen das wir unsere Unterkunft zwei mal in Folge gebucht haben. Die Kommunikation ist sehr zuvorkommend  wir hatten einen Parkplatz fr unseren Mietwagen und haben uns rundum wohl und sicher gefhlt Dankeschn fr diese super Unterkunft
690609,241669155,2018-03-10,121309876,Tom,Awesome stay in a cool and funky neighborhood. Plenty of cafs  restaurants  supermarkets. The house is spotless and very spacious even more so than expected. Grazia is a friendly and efficient host. Will definitely go back when in Cape Town.
690609,247605469,2018-03-29,50493805,Steffen,Grazia war eine wunderbare Gastgeberin und hat uns mit ntzlichen Tipps versorgt. Wir haben den Aufenthalt in der Wohnung genossen. Schn war an der Lage  dass es einfach und ein Erlebnis war mit dem Minibus in die Innenstadt zu kommen und dass in der Nhe ein paar sehr nette gar nicht touristische Lokale waren. Der einzige Nachteil unser Auto war zu lang fr den Hof des Hauses  stand Nachts auf der Strae und wurde  aufgebrochen wir hatten nichts im Auto  das geklaut werden konnte  aber natrlich fhlt man sich besser  wenn das nicht vorkommt. Trotz dieses Problems  das wahrscheinlich auch berall in Kapstadt passieren knnte wir wrden jederzeit gerne wiederkommen.
690609,249491053,2018-04-02,54211810,Monique,We stayed at Tom and Grazias place for the Two Oceans. It was the perfect spot to be  central and quiet for an early nights sleep the night before. Grazia recommended an awesome pizza place called Ferdinandos within walking distance. Will definitely be back next year.
690609,254277689,2018-04-16,6522361,Annachiara,Wonderful place Thank you Grazia
690609,255338501,2018-04-20,163451275,William,Great place to stay in eclectic Observatory.  A real Cape Town neighborhood feel close to the university.
690609,260826404,2018-05-05,163047176,Bas,Het is een geweldig huis die van alle gemakken is voorzien. Het enige wat je zou kunnen missen is een afwasmachine. Het huis ligt vlakbij de uitvalwegen naar het centrum toe of richting de gebieden buiten Kaapstad. Tom en Grazia zijn vriendelijke en behulpzame mensen. Wanneer ik nogmaals naar Kaapstad ga  en dit huis is nog in het bezit van Tom en Gracia  huur ik dit huis wederom.
690609,263568454,2018-05-12,54346781,Olaf,Good Time.
690609,266031410,2018-05-19,158671802,Faiyaz,Amazing Experience. Perfect little touches

1075794,101790841,2016-09-15,14976493,Mark,great flat   good light   clean   organized   and with a super-helpful host. being part of a hotel complex makes it easy and provides some foodbar options. the neighborhood has loads of options   and its just a few minutes walk into the centre of CT with all its nightlife and bars.  highly recommended
1075794,104856313,2016-09-28,5252415,Diane,The apartment was exactly as described and just what we needed.  Jenny is absolutely the best  Every email was answered within 2 hours  and she provided an 11 page list of her favorite things in Cape Town  as well as clear directions for the WiFi and sim card.  We would be very happy to stay here again or at any other property Jenny owns.
1075794,106281607,2016-10-05,48370249,Ana,Very satisfied with our stay  it was very comfortable and well situated
1075794,120126066,2016-12-08,14681723,Chermaine,loved our first visit to Cape Town. Jenny was a terrific host who was very helpful. Her apartment was big and clean and in a good location.
1075794,215669925,2017-12-01,5525169,Angela,This is such a brilliant little spot if you are coming to explore Cape Town for work or leisure. Jenny is fabulous and I had he best sleeps of my life
1075794,319323131,2018-09-06,59357564,Kristina,I stayed at Jennys place for 8 nights. The apartment is exactly as it appears online. Nice decor  very clean  and fully stocked kitchen. The building is very secure and near many restaurants and shops. Jenny was quick was to respond to my questions and was very accommodating when I requested to add a night to my stay. Highly recommend
1075794,328190800,2018-09-25,48030246,Alan,Apartment is exactly as described and reflected in pictures. It is very neat and clean. Central to all activities in and around Cape Town  and very safe
1075794,341616664,2018-10-27,2570682,Tony,Comfortable one bed apartment  great location and safe
1075794,367161889,2019-01-04,1159460,Elisha,Restaurants on the property are all good. The local area is LGBTQ friendly  with the majority of the cities gay bars within one block. Check out Long Street for great restaurants  but watch out for pickpocketers on the way there and back. The apartment was clean  great balcony with a view of New Year's Eve waterfront fireworks. The gym is small and the weights are right next to the pool with a slippery floor  which I found odd. Nothing Jenny can do about that though  but you should know. The mattress  in my opinion preference could be replaced.  Otherwise  it was great. Great location  nice building  safe parking  great bars and clubs nearby  great food nearby  the waterfront is a 20-minute walk  lots of other fun things within walking distance. We had a great time
1075794,403130323,2019-01-20,27656750,Greg,Jennys place is amazing and I would definitely stay here again. Very clean  plenty of space  great balcony  and most of all- location  Easily walk to the grocery store as well as shopping  restaurants  and night life.
1075794,440079616,2019-04-20,160018622,Melissa,Incredible apartment  great location  building w nice amenities  solid WiFi and Jenny is the ultimate AirBnb hostess and the management company was super responsive and accomodating. Sunsets from the balcony are spectacular and I loved living here for a month. They even brought me a portable light when there was load shedding  which luckily  does not affect the elevators in the building.
1075794,509921081,2019-08-15,156065122,Kyle,Stayed here for six weeks during a work trip and really loved this apartment. Fantastic location  midway between the VA Waterfront and CBD and walkable to many locations in Cape Town. Also many bars and restaurants very close by. I loved waking up in the morning to eat breakfast on the balcony and watch the sunrise over Table Bay. Will definitely stay here again if I get the chance
1075794,523644098,2019-09-04,20773182,Jonty,Jennys place is perfectly positioned for anyone interested in easy access to the waterfront and surrounding quarter. It was spotlessly clean and her communication and attentiveness was second to none. Cant wait to stay there again.
1075794,564575281,2019-11-16,75345342,Matthew,Wonderful apartment and great host
690609,337670274,2018-10-17,132772507,Caroline,Very spacious and comfortable.  Everything you need.  Quite central.  Would recommend it.  Lovely home
690609,342617400,2018-10-29,213097084,Alexander,Very nice house with much space  a lovely tiny back yard garden  ideal for having breakfast  well fitted kitchen and the whole flat is furnitured and decorated in a very distinguished way  so you can feel immediately comfortable. Nice and good  restaurants are in the very  near down in the Lower Mainroad in middle of the upcoming Observatory area. Check in was also very easy  the houskeeper just waited for me when I arrived in KC.
690609,343641782,2018-11-01,120877564,Kate,the house is a  lovely big space  with wooden floors  high ceilings and tasteful decor. comfortable beds  kitchen with all you need to cook  and interesting books to read. however it felt like the place hadn't been carefully checked since the last check out  as there was no sugar  firelighters etc it was quite chilly and it was tricky to find things like tea. instructions  including info on the area  the alarm system  emergency numbers and on the house's facilities   would have made all the difference. we had to text quite a lot to get answers to our questions - although the responses were always very quick.
690609,346576785,2018-11-09,55788564,Nastasjia-Leigh,Spacious and stylish home close to everything you need. Outstanding communication and hospitality skills from the host. Highly recommended.
690609,360605785,2018-12-21,94602469,Marita,Great location for our purposes and visit to Cape Town. Very central for our needs.
690609,364691551,2018-12-31,9447912,Michal,The house was in a great location  central to many Cape Town tourist sites  etc. The decor was super cool bright  colorful  airy  etc.  giving you an immediate at-home feel. Communication was great  and we were graciously accommodated regarding arrival changes. We would definitely stay again
690609,368115221,2019-01-06,3739919,Katharina,The accommodation was very spacious and ideal for staying with a family of four. The neighbourhood is nice with some cafes and restaurants nearby and it is only a short ride about 10 - 15 minutes to the more central attractions of Cape Town. Communication was always very quick  which was helpful for check-in and check-out.
690609,401588658,2019-01-15,54442344,Teia,Tom and Bernice were excellent hosts - very communicative and friendly. Their home is incredibly beautiful  stylish and filled with a great  calming atmosphere. We enjoyed doing yoga in the courtyard sunshine or sharing a glass of wine in the lounge - a perfect base to explore the surrounding neighbourhood Observatory has a lot to offer And Cape Town in general. Ten out of ten  would stay here again.
690609,420980895,2019-03-08,113661135,Henner,Dies ist eine sehr empfehlenswerte Wohnung in einer ruhigen Strasse in Observatory. 300 m entfernt finden sich eine ganze Reihe von guten Restaurants und Bars  auch abends einfach per Fuss zu erreichen.
690609,422541945,2019-03-11,147116045,Jordan Reece,Not really what I expected  floors creek really loud and could barely play music on a Saturday afternoon without hearing the hungover neighbor screaming about loud music that was hardly even loud at all
690609,423749002,2019-03-15,71885869,Robbin,Well located in the district of Observatory good restaurants nearby etc  the place is clean  well appointed  comfortable  We enjoyed our 4 nights very much.  It did take a bit of effort to get used to the alarm system  but that would be a problem anywhere in South Africa.
690609,426525236,2019-03-21,59779605,Marcus,Tom and Ashley are great hosts who delivers what they promise and more.
690609,428873823,2019-03-26,64295984,Thomas,This place is very conveniently located in Observatory within walking distance of many shops and restaurants. The decor is very stylish and the house itself is beautiful. Of course it was very clean. If you want to explore Cape Town  this is definetely a recommendation to stay at  given its good location and great hosts
690609,430815490,2019-03-31,90457542,Dean,Great little place
690609,436953182,2019-04-14,130873198,Leora,A well located  really comfy home with the added bonus of an off street parking
690609,442410665,2019-04-23,243492557,Karin,We really enjoyed our stay at this house. The bedrooms are spacious and calm  the kitchen is fully equipped for cooking  the outside seating area is great for sunny hours  and the fireplace lovely for cold evenings. The whole house has a special  cheerful spirit - and in walking distance  there are some lovely shops and restaurants.
690609,445373031,2019-04-29,51566041,Dana,The house is charming  with a beautiful walled in hidden garden to sit in. The house has a gate and an alarm so I felt super safe  and the location is quite central as well. Thanks for a great stay
690609,449152426,2019-05-06,88836591,Jos,We enjoyed our stay. Its really easy to get in contact with them during your stay  which makes that any problems are solved quick. We would stay again
690609,455850923,2019-05-20,95534263,Kethlyn,Stylish layout within close vicinity of all the shops that you need. Friendly host who is very flexible with the arrangements
690609,471263882,2019-06-17,4883318,Helcia,Very charming house  big and stylisch. Ideal kitchen. Communication with host was perfect  Tom  Bernice and Ashley were very friendly and helpfull.
690609,563827913,2019-11-14,123156544,Liezel,Home away from home We loved staying here  the location is perfect for where we needed to be and we had everything to be super comfortable.  The house is spacious and beautiful  it was hard to go out for our business meetings
690609,586617551,2020-01-02,240372637,Noma,Na
690609,591391080,2020-01-11,20482833,Richard,The first thing that surprised me about the place was the space It's quite large  sunny  and the rooms are spacious. The home has a lovely feel to it and all of the amenities you could ask for. Having a washing machine was such a fantastic bonus. The car pad out front is small but super clean and sufficient for a compact car  which also came in quite handy. The area is within easy walking distance to several cafes and a spar grocery store. You can take a cheap uber to just about anywhere from here as well. Highly recommend this place  especially for longer stays  and will do so myself the next time I'm in Cape Town.
690609,596259242,2020-01-22,211995068,Allan,Nice centrally located house
690609,598856973,2020-01-28,43993645,William,A really great place. Clean  spacious and secure. If you are for whatever reason unsure of what there is to see and do in Observatory  just ask  the hosts are extremely helpful.
690609,600731494,2020-02-02,255567190,Stephanie,A home away from home We loved our stay in this Obs house  perfectly located for our purposes  wonderfully clean with all the necessary amenities. It is lovely  spacious and safe and we look forward to our next visit. The hosts are super friendly and accommodating.
690609,604454940,2020-02-11,271091842,Milena,A very lovely and very safe house in the vibrant and young part of Cape Town  Observatory. We especially enjoyed the very spacious living area inside and outside. Definitely the right place to stay if you want to be surrounded by locals and still be able to reach the city centre and all major attractions with a short drive.
690609,614138529,2020-03-04,169897594,Nico,The apartment was really nice and save. Had a good time.
690609,506321584698809507,2021-11-29,241823163,Tim,A great place to stay in Obs  close to the action but not too close. Well equipt kitchen  nicely furnished  very nice little back yard  comfortable beds  and good security. Also  Ashley is very helpful and quick to respond. Would definitely recommend for both short and longer stays. Thanks
1075794,587577406,2020-01-03,823235,Alice,Great location Amazing balcony. Always felt secure and safe. Thanks Jenny
1075794,594244654,2020-01-18,13023701,Giovanni,Everything great. The place is well located and has a lot of facilities gym and swimming pool at level 1 included
1075794,719048475,2020-12-28,329589817,Emile,We had a great stay. The location is perfect and the apartment is great
1075794,730965487,2021-02-14,258826675,Danyelle,One exercise at your own risk just know that for the money is not the nicest place and needs to be updated. Other then that just know that the management is not always politically correct and will not solve your problem. And they constantly need to get in your apartment to always check on something to do something so if youre coming to just rest and relax forget it
1075794,744892295,2021-04-03,37428326,Robert,Great spot  fantastic host.  Very communicative and made such everything was perfect.
1075794,749696426,2021-04-18,234064675,Johan,Clean perfect flat in a secure building and area close to shops and restaurants.

690609,536734306631159853,2022-01-10,66045463,Attiya,My two siblings and I had an excellent stay at a wonderful home in Obs. The kitchen has all the amenities you would need for cooking. The washing machine was great to have because we stayed for almost 3 weeks. The location was perfect for exploring both Cape Town and its surroundings. We rented a car and it fit perfectly in the entryway though there was able ample street parking available. Ashely and Bernice were excellent hosts and are very easy to communicate with.  As other reviews state  the home is much larger than it looks in photos. The two bedrooms easily fit all our suitcases with ease. Everything was very easy and comfortable for a long stay in Cape Town. A note for light sleepers that the neighbor during our visit hosted a couple of parties with loud music on the weekends but we did visit during the Festive SeasonNew Years. However  these were usually over by 12am.
690609,546129122918257762,2022-01-23,52162663,Elle,Its our fourth time in this area. Obs is a nice place. And Ashley is a great host

Very comfy king-size bed  good linen  and the most hangers I have every seen in an Airbnb  Very well-equipped kitchen and really nice shower. The courtyard is totally private and sunny  a lovely place to relax. Communication with either Bernice or Ashley was friendly and efficient  and the check-in and check-out processes trouble-free. We had a very pleasant stay and would definitely recommend this cottage.

They both enjoyed their stay. In regard to communication  everything was promptly responded to. Only issue was requesting an additional heater for the second bedroom due to the lowering temperatures at night. Unfortunately our request was denied which was a little disappointing.

690609,804204815891275847,2023-01-14,55872410,Judith,We had a lovely stay and felt right at home in the cosy and nicely decorated house. We enjoyed the neighbourhood  many nice restaurants to eat  great vintage shops and also a nice playground nearby for our little one. It is also very well located for day trips and outings to Cape Towns many beautiful and interesting sites to see. Two negative aspects about the house were the ants in the kitchen and dining area that were numerous  and the weak wifi signal. A new rooter was being installed after our stay and measures would be taken again to get rid of the ants the owners said to us. So that should make future stays even more comfortable.

The location is close to the center of town and the city center is entirely walkable. The two day pass on the City Sightseeing double decker buses was a great way to get around.
697880,3187695,2012-12-30,1492331,Alessandro,Good family attached apartment  people very friendly in such a lovely place. It's not so close to the city that you could walk down and find things but they have people to take you for better prices than regular taxi. The place use to receive students and so they are very helpful. Internet is usually charged but we got it for free. There is food so you can make your own breakfast. Place was cleaned two times in the week. Thanks Rudy and family for the staying  wish you and your family the best.

They really made us feel welcom.

697880,3869685,2013-03-23,1013078,Alyssa And Edward,Angela and Faizel may be the friendliest  nicest couple in Cape Town Though we showed up earlier than the time we had told them  they were apologetic about not being there to let us in They proceeded to share sushi and wine with us...all the while continuing to apologize On a different day  they invited us to share dinner with them on another day  Faizel shared a delicious butternut squash soup with us. Additionally  they had all sorts of food in the fridge just in case eggs  yogurt  milk  fruit  bread. SO THOUGHTFUL The neighbors are also wonderful and friendly  The cottage is in the perfect location with lovely views walkable to central Cape Town in one direction  vibey Woodstock in the other about 25 mins each. At the cottage  it's stocked with plenty of maps and information about things to do around CPT...the MyCiti bus stop is less than a block away so convenient. The apartment is clean  great size  well-stocked with whatever's needed  quiet neighborhood. laundry done same day...we'll definitely stay here again the next time we're in Cape Town.

1081311,713410443,2020-12-05,320281752,Marius,I recommend Renate's Place For The Short Stay Traveller  Business and even Longer Duration Stay. You will find few and far apart equal value for money or experience.
1081311,716160945,2020-12-18,332232253,Mary,Renate is a very good host..The space is cozy and comfortable.
1081311,722305711,2021-01-06,150222252,Mark,Great place  great host
697880,4055797,2013-04-06,5556703,John,Our stay at the cottage was great the place is very neat and cosey  has exellent views and is in close distance to various points of interest. The hosts Angela and Faizel are great people who truely enjoy the company of their guests.
697880,4687292,2013-05-20,2911273,Shaun,There really isn't a single negative thing to say about this place Perfect for a solo traveller or couple.  Location could not be better. 17 minutes from the airport and 7 minutes to the Waterfront.
697880,5712443,2013-07-13,1459446,Katie,We had a lovely stay at Angela and Faizel's cottage. They were perfect hosts  very courteous and kind and generous. We were even treated to a lovely meal prepared by Angela including a curry dish  samosas  and sweet fritters. Such sweet people with an interest in meeting people and getting to know those who travel the world. We were not there long enough but our stay was perfect and the cottage was just the right place for us. Very clean  towels and blankets provided. The refrigerator was stocked with lovely breakfast provisions. We look forward to returning one day and spending more time in one of our favorite cities in the world.
697880,6288812,2013-08-06,2886831,Jen,Angela's cottage was great It was very well located to get to everything in Cape Town. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. We had a wonderful weekend there and it was definitely too short.
697880,7576814,2013-09-25,7299632,Matt,Angela and Faizel were wonderful hosts. When we arrived  they immediately greeted us like we were visiting relatives  and that is how we were treated for the following week. We were able to drop off a large load of clothes immediately  and they were returned to us laundered within 24 hours. On our last night in Cape Town  Angela and Faizel had us over for a delicious Indian meal. It was a bit chilly in the bungalow -- which was probably more a function of the temperature that week -- so if you visit in the winter or spring  I would recommend packing pajamas. But the location has a spectacular view of the harbor  the neighborhood is perfectly safe  and again  Angela and Faizel were delightful.
697880,7801061,2013-10-03,2852045,Samanthi,Angela was very welcoming  easy to reach and communicate with and offers wonderful rooms. In the end  I did not stay at the cottage but in the main house as I arrived earlier than planned. I can highly recommend staying with her and her husband.
697880,8364374,2013-10-28,7447150,David,Angela and Fisel are terrific hosts.  When we arrived  they welcomed us to their home  offered us cold drinks  and answered our questions about Cape Town and South Africa we were first time visitors.  The accommodations are great  bedroom  living room  kitchen  bath.  Free wifi with computer provided  refrigerator stocked with eggs  milk  etc  in summary  a great value.  The location is excellent  with a nice view of Cape Town and the harbor.  Table Mountain is just behind the house  and a convenience storerestaurant just a block away.  Easy access to major highways and downtown.  Highly recommended.
697880,8486072,2013-11-02,596423,Kimberly,A great place in a great location - Angela and Faizel made sure we were comfortable with breakfast supplies and even a bottle of wine on a rainy day Proximity to bus stop is very handy and the views are gorgeous. If you don't fancy the bus  you can still walk to some great neighbourhoods.
697880,8576458,2013-11-05,2183907,Alejandro,This is by far the best choice for an accommodation in Cape Town. Angela and her family are very pleasant people. You have a separate big are for your own  sort of like a separated house  which a nice view to Capetown center  which is at walking distance. Bed is comfy and you have everything you need to be more than comfortable there. Angela arranged a pick-up from the airport with Ismael the driver who can also provide service taking you to the most important spots wineries  cheetas  penguin excursions  etc so I absolutely recommend this place and this people.
1081311,723240236,2021-01-10,348193484,Ryno,It was an overall great stay Highly recommend

697880,8684456,2013-11-12,4905797,Jim,The cottage was great  but the hosts were even better. Angela and her husband are so very gracious. They welcomed me and my wife into there home not as tenants but friends. Upon arrival  there was eggs and fruit left in the kitchen for us.  After a long flight  those little things are so very important  The cottage was perfect.  10 minutes from the airport  located near the old District 6 area on the hill  with private parking behind a gate.  Cape Town is at a bit of a loss when it comes to mass transit  but there is a bus line that is a 2 minute walk down the hill  which can take you downtown.  The views are top notch  and 10-15 mintue driving distance to Table Top Mountain. The kitchen has all the pots  and pans you could want  and even if it doesn't  Angela is the type of person to let you borrow whatever you need.  Rest assured your in good hands with great people.
697880,8812729,2013-11-19,8346974,Rhonda,We were extremely pleased with the week we spent at Private Garden Cottage and would recommend it to others. In addition to having a very comfortable and safe place to stay  the location is close to the downtown area and the N2  making it easy to get anywhere  yet far enough away from the traffic noise. The patio view towards the harbour was lovely. Angela and Faizel were also perfect hosts  providing lots of valuable local knowledge and even entertaining us one evening. Go and enjoy
697880,9158441,2013-12-10,889725,Kevin,Angela and Faizel offer so much more than you'd expect from an airbnb. The unit itself is great - private  plenty of space  and very comfortable. The location is also ideal - close to the city center without being in a busy or loud neighborhood. What makes this place so special are the hosts. They are both so welcoming and friendly we felt like they knew us. They told us when we arrived that they wanted to do what they could to make sure we enjoyed our time in Cape Town  and they followed up on it with great sincerity by answering questions and making helpful suggestions when we told them our plans. We'll miss them just as much as we'll miss the city.
697880,9403155,2013-12-27,9325748,Bernie,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Garden Cottage   Angela and Faizel are warm and generous hosts  they made us feel very welcome. The  spacious  well equipped  flat is well positioned with easy access to Cape Town and surrounding areas  and has off street parking .The starter breakfast pack was very helpful until we found the local shops. Angela and Faizel also hosted us on Christmas Eve for the evening introducing us to their fellow guests which was much appreciated. This is a good base for visitors wishing to explore Cape Town.
697880,9631998,2014-01-04,7548866,Lindsey,Angela and her family were so wonderfully warm and welcoming  we felt immediately at home upon our arrival in Cape Town. She even stocked the fridge and pantry with some food and drink for us  so very thoughtful and helpful in every way. The accommodation is lovely  clean and inviting. We highly recommend a stay here and hope to see them for a drink before we leave South Africa
697880,9753428,2014-01-08,6309280,Jrg,Geduldiger Empfang trotz stundenlanger Versptung. Sehr freundliche Vermieter und Gastgeber jederzeit ansprechbar und hilfsbereit. Tolle Lage in der Stadt  normales und bunters Stadtleben im Viertel  in wenigen Autominuten an der Waterfront wunderschner Blick ber den Industriehafen von Kapstadt. Umgeben von freundlichen und aufmerksamen Nachbarn. Parkplatz im Hof. Sehr empfehenswert - auch mit Kind unsere Tochter war 4 Jahre alt
697880,9896834,2014-01-18,175731,Ann Kathrin,It really is a home away from home at Angela's and Faizal's place. Convenient location  lovely terrace  a stocked up fridge and beers and ice cream on arrival. It was just amazing. Thanks a lot
697880,10144512,2014-02-03,9467743,Billy,Angela and Faisal were exceptional hosts. We  really appreciated their generosity. On arrival we found the fridge filled with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. my wife was sick for a couple of days and they showed great care. The cottage was independent clean and had a lovely outside space. The bus route which passes outside the cottage  takes you to the city centre. Staying here was a very positive experience and we would definitely return if in Cape Town again.
697880,11276347,2014-03-28,7877659,Bryan,My partner and I stayed in Angela and Faizel's private garden cottage for most of March 2014 and had a wonderful stay. Angela had stocked the fridge when we arrived  so grocery shopping wasn't an immediate concern. The patio looks down over the area of Woodstock  the docks and Table Bay. It is easy walking distance to bars  restaurants and the Biscuit Mill in Woodstock and to the city centre. If you aren't a walker  the 102 bus goes in both directions. The real plus to booking here is the couple themselves. The flat is attached to their home. They respect your privacy but were warm and welcoming often going well above and beyond to ensure our needs were being met and helping to navigate their fascinating city.
697880,11511938,2014-04-06,12644219,Martin,Cozy and private cottage  well situated in Cape Town to venture out easily. Angela and Faizel are a very hospitable couple  whom respected our privacy  yet shared a nice evening and a Braai with us. Highly recommended.
697880,11860099,2014-04-17,4386567,Ollie,We had a great stay at the White House in Walmer estate. The cottage suited us perfectly as a base to explore Cape Town. Well maintained  quiet and private and secure  with adequate parking space and decent wifi. Everything we needed. Angela and Faizel are lovely hosts to boot  accommodating  relaxed and happy to assist and help out. We would definitely stay again and recommend to others.
697880,11996812,2014-04-21,5880581,Alexandre,We have spent 4 days in Angela's cottage and it was wonderful It was clean  independant  and really lovely. Well situated  near the downtown with a beautiful view.  and Angela and her husband are worried about our comfort.
697880,12645820,2014-05-06,1793504,Dea,Angela and her family were very sweet and thoughtful. They gave us nice tips and we felt at home right away The cottage is cosy and has a nice view. We hope to come back

697880,22203407,2014-11-01,12440636,Sam,Angela's place was a perfect base for a busy two days in Cape Town. Angela and her husband were very welcoming and providing a few extras in the fridge was a very nice touch. The house was exactly as advertised  spotless and secure with everything you could need for a stay. Angela offered to answer all our questions and key exchange was seamless. I hope to visit again.
697880,23677022,2014-12-08,6717401,Marieke,We had a great time exploring Cape Town from Angela's and Faisal's cottage. They are extremely friendly and welcoming. On our first night  we got delicious home-made food so we didn't have to leave the cottage again. Kitchen is well equiped and we made breakfast ourselves every morning - which we enjoyed on the terrass outside. It is a lovely place and definitely recommended to others

1081311,1014409714726400006,2023-10-31,497326010,Tsholofelo,Renate is sweet and very responsive host. Place is outside of town therefore very quite and peaceful so if your looking to get some work done definitely the place for you. There is a tenant in the house very sweet always helpful and able to give you your space. Its more like home really . Check in is flexible and she allowed me to check out later after 3 actually so shes very understanding. My stay was super amazing and public transport is easily accessible
1081311,1036157212023766684,2023-11-30,526275261,Samuel,Nice place  really clean just like the picture Renate was friendly  I will love to visit next time

697880,25131021,2015-01-07,21724608,Jacqueline,We had the most wonderful time at Angela's cottage. It's centrally located  with a stunning view of the CT harbor. It's got everything you need for a pleasant stay right there. The area is quiet  so no trouble sleeping either. There is parking right on the premises. And most of all  Angela and her husband and extended family are wonderful hosts. We would have loved to stay for longer. ... Till next time  Angela. -
697880,25708359,2015-01-24,22711435,Amy,Angela's garden cottage is a slice of heaven beautiful gardens  comfy bedroom  stocked kitchen  wonderful neighborhood My husband and I stayed in Angela's cottage for 2 weeks. The cottage is very comfortable and has plenty of room for a married couple to--be cozy but also have their own space The neighborhood is very nice and conveniently located between downtown and the trendy Woodstock neighborhood. Angela and her family are some of the most friendly and delightful people we meet in Cape Town. Angela and her family went above and beyond to make us feel at home I highly recommend Angela's listings and when we return to Cape Town hopefully sooner than later we will definitely be returning to Angela's Cottage.
697880,26489725,2015-02-14,26037628,Barrie,This was our first experience of Airbnb and it could not have been better.  The property  a former granny annexe to the owner's house  is superbly located close to downtown and the Waterfront  and has a sunny terrace overlooking the port with Robben Island in the distance.  Angela and Faisal could not have been more welcoming or more flexible hosts.  We arrived at 9.00 straight from an overnight flight from London.  We were offered a bedroom and bathroom to freshen up and breakfast although we were happy just to have coffee.  When we got into the property  we found it extremely well stocked with basics like milk  eggs and fruit  obviating the need for a immediate visit to the supermarket.  Angela and Faisal are both charming  and have interesting stories to tell about their  and ther families'  experiences under apartheid.  All in all  a great start to a holiday in a wonderful city.
697880,27036339,2015-02-23,5653005,Evan,Angela has a great place the White House very close to Cape Town city center. We had a great stay there. Angela went over and above what was advertise and helped accommodate us the best she could. I definitely recommend her place to anyone traveling to Cape Town Thanks Angela
697880,27723925,2015-03-10,15739592,Niamh,We had such a great time the location was really handy and with great views. Both Angela and Faisal were so welcoming and made us feel like we were staying with family.
697880,29189595,2015-04-05,28648777,Dethorn,This was my very first airbnb experience and I must say Angela was a awesome host. I was greeted at the gate with a friendly smile and a warm hug. Upon entering the cottage Angela surprised with me with a bouquet of South Africa's traditional Protea flowers and a birthday card.  She and her husband were very thoughtful.  I would definitely recommend this place as it in a secret gem nested minutes from city centre'.
697880,33371592,2015-05-27,30769258,Nikkole,Angela and her husband were great hosts They welcomed us warmly  though we arrived after dark and Angela proceeded to give us a tour of The White House. Our trip was short  but Angela provided a very cozy  home-away-from home stay. She even went so far as to leave us light breakfast fare as we arrived late and didn't have time to go to the grocery store. I can't sing her praises enough. She's as available or unavailable as you want her to be. We plan to stay at her cottage if we make it back to Cape Town 
697880,46946937,2015-09-14,39007023,Dr H.A.,This was my first time using AirBnB - and I have been spoiled indefinitely  I suspect. It will be hard for others to come close to the hospitality that this host and her husband showed the care they took in ensuring I was well taken care of and the standard of the accommodation. I've no complaints whatsoever  and I am reticent to recommend it to others for one reason alone - I want to come back again and again  and I don't want anyone else occupying it - Angela was very flexible about when I arrived and when I departed she ensured I had a full stock of supplies that should have lasted easily a couple of days if not more. It was a nice  spacious guest house  with full facilities - very comfortable for a couple  and one could easily put another person on a pull out couch as well. And when you walked out the front door in the morning  you had a lovely view of the sea - in the evening  it was the tantalising lights of the harbour. You'll be very well taken care of here. Oh  and PS - Uber works in Cape Town  and that was a great way to get around - but you also had the bus that takes you into town.
697880,50502695,2015-10-12,23817380,Noeleen,Very warm and welcoming hosts who could not do enough for us. Lovely  clean and spacious place as well as fully equipped at a reasonable price. Well situated near the centre of Cape Town with a glorious view of the waterfront. Also secure parking. We will definitely stay with these lovely people again.
697880,51624577,2015-10-22,32162040,Casey,Angela and her husband were great host They had food in the fridge  provided bus cards we could use to get around town  and even gave us dinner on the night we arrived since we were so tired to travel anywhere The place was beautiful and clean and I would recommend anyone stay here
697880,52309279,2015-10-28,7303991,Karin,I stayed for the second time at Angela's place. I felt at home - like two years before. Sie is a lovely host. Angela's place is located in a safe nighbourhood in Cape Town  where you find nice restaurants and shops for your daily needs nearby. You can even easily take the bus from there to the city centre.
697880,52612017,2015-10-31,44644791,Cedric,Great hosts. Great location. Missed aircon. Will recommend.
697880,53077237,2015-11-04,47122650,Sonila,Angela was the perfect host . My parents were delighted and were very happy with the stay. Thank you so much Angela for making their stay special . I will myself want to experience your place one day and highly recommend it to others .
697880,53628989,2015-11-10,1739891,Susan,Words cannot describe the hospitality that Angela and Faizel gave us. We stayed in the one bedroom apartment next to their home. Our flight arrived late and Angela was kind enough to stock the refrigerator with some breakfast items for us. Everything was well appointed  including a safe and a hairdryer. They also invited us for a drink and some snacks one evening and also to meet their neighbor. It was lovely to hear about their story and lives living in Cape Town.
1101917,9078418,2013-12-05,7394272,Peter,Alles absolut perfekt Das Haus liegt in einer wunderschnen Gegend und ist von allen Richtungen gut zu erreichen. Die Ausstattung lsst keine Wnsche brig. Der Gastgeber sehr freundlich und entgegenkommend. Es gibt nichts negatives zu sagen. Wir wren gerne noch lnger geblieben.
697880,54247272,2015-11-17,45840361,Paul,Very welcoming hosts who couldn't be more helpful.  The location is great in that it has wonderful views across the harbour  its easy to park and is in a nice secure neighbourhood. The accommodation is large with a separate lounge and a well stocked kitchen for breakfast.  The wi-fi is good  so its easy to call an uber cab much better than a taxi with just a short ride to some great local restaurants in Woodstock. We would definitely use again  particularly in preference to the expensive harbour front hotels.
697880,54507605,2015-11-21,44480681,Lukas,Es war einfach super Angela und ihr Mann haben uns freundlich empfangen. Das Kleine Huschen hatten wir fr uns alleine. Wir durften das Auto auf dem Innhof paktieren. Als wir ankamen war der Khlschrank gefllt und wir mussten nichts zum Frhstck kaufen fr die ganzen 4 Tage. Wir fhlten uns immer sicher und gut umsorgt. Die Lage ist super um einige Tage in Kapstadt zu verweilen und Ausflge in die Umgebung zu unternehmen. Am Ende wollten wir gar nicht mehr gehen und Sie htten uns glaube ich auch gerne lnger behalten. Doch Sie sind immer gut ausgebucht  kein Wunder
697880,55677713,2015-12-04,49197168,Sofia,We had a very good time in cape town  Angela and Faizel were the nicest with us which helped us to get over the loss of our luggages. I would recommend their place to friends of mine without any doubt
697880,60726140,2016-01-26,2791393,Kaunteya, The cottage is perfectly located only 5 minutes from downtown in a friendly neighbourhood where I loved going for walks. It is private  comfortable and spacious and enjoys a nice view of the port and bay. We especially loved having our breakfast in the garden.  Angela and Faisal themsleves are kind and wonderful people with whom we enjoyed many interesting conversations and we feel we could have so many more  We are touched by their kindness and staying with them was an utterly heartwarming experience.
1101917,9731929,2014-01-07,6864642,Thomas,Waking to silence  punctuated by the calls of the Hadedas  to blue skies  to leisurely breakfasts on a sunny covered patio in a verdant lush garden  with beautiful vistas of the surrounding mountains what more can one ask for But there IS more the house is spacious  bright  clean and uncluttered  lending itself to simple modern open living  where all amenities and comforts have been thought of. It is a wonderful safe home from home  perfect for just about any kind of holiday. Its location is quiet  but within an easy 10 minutes drive to an excellent shopping mall Constantia Village  and within a 5 minutes drive to one of Cape Towns main arteries into the city and out to the beaches in the southern suburbs. Our lovely hosts Martin and Robyn were most hospitable  accessible  and responsive to our every whim. Our 4-year old daughter enjoyed herself immensely  spending many happy hours playing in the pool and on the jungle gym in the garden  with Martin and Robyns daughter Ava. We loved it here and felt so at home.  Given the opportunity we will return once again in a flush  
1101917,9997003,2014-01-24,4714434,Pamela,Great property surrounded by hiking trails directly behind house  and within literally 1 to 2 minutes drive. Beautiful golf courses nearby too. Really enjoyed the small wine farm Glen Constantia less than 3 minute drive down the road for beautiful views and a tasty charcuterie  cheese plate. Also really enjoyed Steenburg golf  as the whole Constantia area just has incredible views.
697880,61281338,2016-02-02,44492692,Claudine,Nous avons pass une excellente semaine dans cette location. Les propritaires sont des gens charmants qui se plient en quatre pour toujours faire plaisir  Merci encore  eux deux pour leur  gentillesse et les petites attentions
697880,62374267,2016-02-14,669665,Christopher,Angela was a gracious and welcoming host The cottage was in the perfect location for our trip and it made our Cape Town experience that much more wonderful. I would recommend Angela and her listings to all my friends
697880,64233554,2016-03-01,26469871,Samantha,Angela's Cottage is absolutely beautiful  It is located within walking distance to downtown and has amazing views of the harbor.  The cottage is located beside the main house and it is a very lovely neighborhood to stay in.  The home reminds me a several nice bed and breakfast stays that I have had in the past.  There is also a ''MyCiti bus stop a block away in case you choose not to take the 20 minute walk to city center.  Upon arrival Angela provided fresh fruit  juice and stocked the fridge with breakfast items.  Angela and her entire family were such gracious hosts during my stay.  I was able to spend two evenings with Angela and her family discussing travel and South Africa.  I received so many helpful tips with regards to South Africa tourism and culture from Angela and her Husband.  I enjoyed staying in South Africa and this AirBnb so much that I extended my stay.   I would definitely recommend Angela's cottage to other guest.
697880,64934771,2016-03-09,21558897,Evelyne,Trs bon accueil arrangement possible au niveau de l'heure d'arrive des cartes de bus personnelles  mises  disposition  de quoi faire un petit djeuner dans le refrigerateur
1101917,11521765,2014-04-06,12048085,Patrick,Martin is an attentive and detail oriented host. This house might be the best base camp in Cape Town - close to Constantia hiking trails and Kirstenbosch  a quick jump to laid back and beautiful Hout Bay  and only a few minutes up some extraordinary coastline to Cape Town CBD. The house is clean  well appointed  and exudes relaxation. What a pleasure.
1101917,20504806,2014-09-30,5823141,Aneta,Martin should write a book for airbnb hosts  Everything from the house  communication  ease of check-in and check-out  through to cleanliness and little details like perfectly ironed sheets made for an amazing stay to rival any top-end hotel.  The house is quite large with 3 bedrooms and easily accommodates a family of 6.  Although it is located on the same plot as Martin's house  it feels secluded and private because of the design of the garden.  The location is also perfect - quiet  residential area within minutes of hiking trails  wine routes and easy access to other parts of the city.  The perfect base in Cape Town.
1101917,21580901,2014-10-20,6581002,Berol,We had a terrific stay. It was even better than on the pictures and our host fabulous.  The location is perfect for a Cape Town Holiday being so central to everything yet very safe.  We enjoyed the fact that we had access to internet in the home as we both had to do business while away on holiday.  I would definitely visit again
1101917,23354408,2014-11-30,11694000,Delia,We had an absolutely wonderful time during our stay in the Upper Constantia Guest House  We debated staying in a hotel in the city or in a house in the suburbs and could not have been happier with our choice.  Constantia is a beautiful suburb right outside Cape Town - secluded from the chaos of the city but close enough to all major points of interest. The property is gated and secure and the drives through the Constantia neighborhood were quite serene. The house is gorgeous and true to the pictures posted. It's particularly well suited for families. There is a playground in the backyard and a pool connected to the house and tons of space to spread out. Martin and Robyn live right next door and were always available for any questions or requests we had.  Martin brought over a bunch of toys for our kids to play with and they even graciously joined us for some wine on our last night - what a wonderful opportunity to get to know two very interesting and well traveled individuals.   Overall  a great place to stay and I would recommend the house and Martin and Robyn as hosts unconditionally.
1101917,29547528,2015-04-09,8648399,Catherine,A very relaxing long weekend in a very comfortable and well equipped house. Perfect size and layout for a family. Kids absolutely loved running around in the garden - such freedom for 2 city boys. We barely left the house - everything we needed for a total break was right there. Very accommodating and welcoming hosts. We will certainly be back soon .
1101917,59457892,2016-01-11,28200376,Michelle,Words do not do this house justice. Its even better then the pictures suggest. A perfect villa in a stunning location and our host made sure that we had everything we needed at all times. We have young children and it is extremely kid friendly which made our stay even better. Would recommend 100 and would definitely go back
1101917,133028802,2017-02-20,21330185,Zoe,A truly wonderful house and Martin and Robyn could not have been more kind and helpful during our stay. I would not hesitate to recommend to my family and friends
1101917,139662961,2017-03-26,21026891,Nick,Martin and Robyn were fantastic hosts and extremely accommodating Their home is immaculate and exactly as described. We sincerely enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone considering Thanks again
1101917,142468051,2017-04-08,51988253,Euan,Excellent spacious property in a beautiful location. Even better than the pictures suggest Very well equipped and spotlessly clean we especially appreciated the bean to cup coffee machine in the mornings. Our kids loved playing in the pool and beautifully tended gardens. A great base for exploring Cape Town and surrounding area with family. Martin and Robyn are wonderful hosts  and we hope to return on our next visit to Cape Town. Highly recommended.
1101917,145124670,2017-04-17,4552211,Katherine,Beautiful home. Very secure for children with a huge garden to play in Also a lovely fire place to enjoy on chilly evenings
1101917,147377859,2017-04-26,117435615,Geanne,It was perfect for us and we had the best time. Superb location as a whole. An awesome feeling of being up in the trees. Loved being surrounded by all the greenbelts for trail running and cycling. Great home-from-home comforts. Would I recommend this beautiful home to friends and family Absolutely YES
1101917,176513640,2017-07-31,97075333,Andrea,We stayed at this beautiful house for the month of July with two adults and three little kids. It's a lovely space and a lot larger than we guessed from the pictures with each of the three bedrooms having extra space and ensuite bathrooms. The outdoor living spaces are beautiful  and our kids loved the backyard. I think it would be even better when it's warmer  and the pool is open. We will definitely return and highly recommend it. Had a small issue with the bath tub  but that will be replaced  and only wish the bedroom next to the master bedroom had a door-have to be extra quiet with kids in it  or could be odd with adults in that room. Otherwise perfect place And we loved the neighborhood  it was ideal. Close to vineyards  a great shopping area  restaurants  beaches  even downtown.
1101917,186920453,2017-08-26,17014079,Detlef,--- English version below --- Wir hatten eine sehr gute Zeit im Haus von Martin und Robyn und der Aufenthalt in Upper Constantia nach einer dreiwchigen Safari in Namibia und Botswana eine tolle Abrundung des gesamten Urlaubs. Bereits der Kontakt bei der Buchung und im unmittelbaren Vorfeld des Besuchs war ausgesprochen unkompliziert und sehr freundlich geprgt. Am Ankunftstag wurden wir von Martin und Robyn und ihrer Familie ausgesprochen warmherzig empfangen und herumgefhrt. und alle ggf. wichtigen Details wurden erklrt Das Haus liegt wunderschn in einem groen Grundstck und ist von einem sehr gepflegten Garten umgeben  dessen alter Baumbestand eine heimelige Atmosphre vermittelt. Es gibt einen Pool und rund um das Haus mehrere Mglichkeiten sich drauen gemtlich hinzusetzen. Die nachbarschaftliche Umgebung ist sehr ruhig und fr erstmalige Besucher in Sdafrika vielleicht wichtig macht einen sehr sicheren Eindruck. Die Innenrume sind sehr geschmackvoll gestaltet und eingerichtet. Wir haben uns sofort wohl gefhlt. Da wir im Winter dort waren und es an den Abenden doch khl wurde  haben wir die Nutzung des Kaminofens im Wohnzimmer sehr genossen und gemtliche Abende dort verbracht. Am Anfang hatten wir noch einige Fragen und Bitten  die alle sehr prompt und beantwortet bzw. erfllt wurden. Dass die Rume zwischendurch mehrfach gereinigt und z.B. die Handtcher ausgewechselt wurden  hat uns ehr positiv berraschet. Mit so einem tollen Service hatten wir nicht gerechnet. Wir haben in der Zeit sehr schne Ausflge nach Kapstadt und in die Umgebung gemacht und fanden die Lage in Upper Constantia dafr sehr gut geeignet. Mit dem Wagen ist man sehr unkompliziert und in angemessener Zeit an verschiedenen interessanten Punkten. In der Umgebung Constatia  Newlands gibt es gute Einkaufsmglichkeiten und zahlreiche sehr gute Restaurants  wenn man nicht selber kochen will. Was unbedingt noch erwhnt werden muss In der Kche gibt es eine erstklassige Kaffeemaschine  die superfeinen Kaffee  Espresso etc. zubereitet Wir wrden sofort wieder dort unterkommen wollen bei einem nchsten Aufenthalt in Kapstadt. Noch einmal ein ganz dickes Dankeschn an euch  Martin und Robyn English Version We had a very good time at the house of Martin and Robyn the stay in Upper Constantia after a three week safari in Namibia and Botswana was topping up our entire vacation. Already the contact at the booking and in the immediate advance of the visit was very uncomplicated and very friendly. On the day of arrival we were welcomed warmly by Martin and Robyn and their family. We had a very nice tour through house and premises getting explained everything which might have been important. The house is beautifully situated in a large property and is surrounded by a very well-tended garden  whose old trees provide a homey atmosphere. There is a pool and around the house several possibilities to sit outside comfortably. The neighborhood is very quiet and for first time visitors in South Africa possibly important makes a very safe impression. The interiors are very tastefully designed and furnished. We immediately felt comfortable. Since we were there in the winter and it was cool in the...
697880,65344215,2016-03-13,51676415,Iain,The hosts made us feel very welcome  They were kind and friendly with lots of good advice  without being intrusive.  They invited us to a family meal on our last night and they made us all feel at home.  We would highly recommend them  The apartment was very clean and comfortable with everything we needed and very easy to get into town and back again.
697880,66670077,2016-03-24,8037736,Roderick,What a wonderful stay. This was my second time to stay at Angela's beautiful cottage and I will stay with here again. It's situated on the My Citi bus route and close to the Cape a Of Hope Castle. The views from this cottage are simply breath taken. Angela and her family are such wonderful hosts that you feel like family when you leave. This was the best place to stay.
697880,68971163,2016-04-08,14315353,Doreen,This was my first Cape Town AirBnB experience and it was great I was traveling for work and the proximity to other colleagues was key.  The cottage is quaint and the hosts thought of everything that needed to be there. The fridge had the necessary provisions thank you for breakfast and cupboards were full of supplies. The wi-fi connection which I used daily was strong. The location was perfect for me safe  local  with great views--just lovely The estate felt like a real friendly neighborhood. Although I was unable to spend time with my the hosts  Angela and Faizel were the most perfect hosts  enthusiastic  interested and also very aware of giving me my privacy. Always available to inform me about anything. I will definitely be back Thank you guys  I had a wonderful time

697880,98649979,2016-09-01,80214011,Jill,We had a fantastic stay The accommodation is conveniently set up in a stunning garden  with an exceptional view of the city and waterfront. It is in an historic part of the city and within easy access of the city centre  Rondebosch and Constantia  as well as to all the drives and highways.  Most of all  Angela and Faizal were lovely hosts  who were responsive to all our needs  welcoming  us into their home and giving us travel tips. Faizal shared with us his love of proteas  giving us a tour of the many kinds blooming in his garden. We were sorry to leave and hope to have a chance to return to what we think of as our Cape Town home.
697880,100641621,2016-09-10,49466975,Joyce,We had a great stay here. Faizal and Angela are very accommodating and welcoming. We felt like we are part of the family cause they made us feel really comfortable  always ready to help. Faizal even gave us free ride going in and out of the city. Their place is really nice The moment I stepped in it I knew I'm gonna love my stay with them. There are foods as well in the fridge for breakfast. I wish we can stay longer. This has exceeded our expectations and I will definitely recommend this place

It was also nice and clean with fresh towels offered every other day. Angela and Faisal were very friendly and welcoming. A complimentary bottle of wine was a nice touch and as they knew we were arriving later than planned and had small kids  they got some bread  milk and cheese and other bits for us which was very thoughtful and very much appreciated. They also gave us some ideas of what to do in CT. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay

1101917,214551584,2017-11-26,6849478,Chiara,We loved this beautiful cottage in Constantia. The house was spacious and there was everything we needed. Its gated and we felt safe and Constantia is just such a nice part of Capetown and all the best restaurants are there. Martin is such a nice host and was always there to help if we needed anything. Its also good that they live just next to the house. It was also super that after checking out he let us stay at their house for a few hours so we could get changed and did not have to wait around the airport. If we are back in SA we would definitely stay at Martins house again.
1101917,216540083,2017-12-04,87057822,Leigh-Anne,What an amazing place Exceeded all our expectations - we absolutely loved it and cant wait to return. Thanks for having us

We definitely  recommend this place to other travellers

They are warm and very welcoming people who will do anything for you to feel at home - which we did The little cottage was very clean and spacious and had a nice little space outside where you can have breakfast or a glass of wine while the sun is setting. The location is great  you can easily and fast get to most places in the city centre and also to the highway if you're going to for instance Stellenbosch  and the airport is just 15 mins away. Also  the cottage has DSTV with football channels  which  was great for us Premier League fans.
697880,225973583,2018-01-08,113169813,Allan,If you are looking for a great place to stay look no further. Angela and Faisal have a wonderful place full of great facilities  added value and kind generosity. Our experience of our hosts was exceptional   they provided a genuine and sincere hospitality experience.  The Cottage is centrally situated and easy to find  the view is sensational and our hosts delightful. Highly recommended for a  lovely stay at a value for money rate.  Thanks Angela and Faisal.
697880,226698613,2018-01-12,4150255,Lindsay,The cottage is a good base for exploring Cape Town for a few days with the added comforts of a kitchen  living room and patio for a bit of R and R. It's a comfortable  roomy space in a residential neighborhood with great views  so was ideal for unwinding at the end of our trip. Thank you Angela and Faisal for your kind hospitality.
697880,227959536,2018-01-17,4315437,Dany,Tout est mis en place pour que le sjour se passe incroyablement bien ici. Les petites attentions d'Angela sont vraiment apprciables. Nous avons pass un sjour absolument extra. Nous y reviendrons sans hsiter. Merci  nos htes.
697880,230861750,2018-01-29,52427490,Heide,Very clean and with everything you need in it. The nicely filled fridge  the coffee and tea  sugar and salt - much appreciated The cottage has a perfect size for a couple  the terrace has lovely harbour views. It's rather quiet and I felt very safe.  You need a rental car up in Walmer Estate  but with some wheels you are at the beach or VA in a couple of minutes. Secure Parking inside the premises a big plus Bonus The doggy is a real sweetheart -.
697880,234806267,2018-02-14,30290855,Nicole,Sehr gut gelegene Unterkunft mit noch netteren Gastgebern. Zwar etwas in die Jahre gekommen  aber zweckmig eingerichtet. Wir waren zufrieden.
697880,236797403,2018-02-20,22986456,Gabriela,Angelas home was perfect for our stay in Cape Town. It was a lovely home away from home. Angela had all the necessities for us  as well as many maps and local pamphlets. Buses were nearby  but it was also a quick uberdrive downtown or other locations. The neighborhood is safe and quiet  and some restaurants are a walk away. I definitely will return and would stay here again

Great location  quiet but close to what Constantia has to offer. Chat to Martin if you are more than 4 adults so he can assist with the one bedroom that is not as private. Children would definitely love the pool and garden. Much enjoyed.

697880,243795726,2018-03-17,45736620,Juliane,Lovely place in a quiet  residential part of WoodstockWalmer Estate with a beautiful view of the harbour. There is not much to do in the area but with a car you can reach everything within 10-15 minutes. Plus You have a private parking which is great. It's a separate apartment with a private outdoor seating area and a small courtyard  perfect for a small child  especially as Angela provides toys as a tricyle. The apartment has lots of storage  all kitchen stuff you would need  a big TV. Kitchen and bath room are basic but absolutely ok. But best are Angela and her husband who are really lovely hosts and very helpful in any respect. We especially decided to stay there because they offer a baby cot and toys  and we would always go back to stay there on our next trip.
697880,247122086,2018-03-27,6640318,Nina,We've had a great stay at Angela and Faizal's cottage. The cottage is located next to the main building  situated in a safe  quiet and friendly neighborhood. Private parking is available. The cottage has a patio with great views on the harbour and braai facilities. The cottage itself was spacious and had everything we needed for our 5-day stay. Angela and Faizal were so kind to provide some amenities in the fridge at our arrival to get us started and assisted us with everything we needed including tools for the braai. They were so helpful and the most wonderful hosts I can definitely recommend their cottage to anyone who is looking for a nice stay in CT.
697880,248746376,2018-04-01,156226023,Tyler,What an amazing host The place was absolutely beautiful. All the small things like packing food and fruit for us was very thoughtful.

It is centrally situated and has a lovely view over Cape Town and the Harbour.

697880,341619161,2018-10-27,212820385,Jarrod,Angela and Faizel are very welcoming and helpful hosts. The apartment is relatively private and within good drivingUbering distance of the City and Waterfront as well as with great proximity to the N2 highway. The apartment got quite warm during our stay midway through a heatwave and it was uncomfortable to be inside in the afternoon. Wed recommend the apartment for a couple travelling together. The apartment is a bit small if you have an active one year old to deal with but Angela went to great lengths to accommodate us she put out toys and a small swimming tub for our little one  and she arranged a crib for us.

697880,350365789,2018-11-19,55401836,Tiara,My husband and I were more than comfortable during our time in the cottage hosted by Angela and Faizel. The cottage was surrounding by beautiful greenery  the bed was very comfortable and the space was more than spacious enough for us to stretch out during our two week stay. They had plenty of towels and linens for us to use  and provided some grocery items for us to use to start us off. Their beautiful dog was so cute and friendly. My rented car was safe and sound as they had parking behind their gates  so I didnt have to worry about street parking. Would definitely recommend for a couples getaway

Weve stayed many times in some lovely places in Cape Towns Southern Suburbs and Martins place is right up there with the best. The outdoor space is perfect with the great pool area and huge covered patio for shade  excellent flow from living space to outdoors  modern kitchen and 3 very comfortable en suite bedrooms.

697880,415288851,2019-02-22,115107763,Danielle,Great cottage private  spacious  sparkling clean  with great views over the harbour and the bonus of off-street parking. Angela thoughtfully provided more than the expected basics  and the fruit was particularly welcome. My husband stayed there alone on a work trip  but after his enthusiastic description  I look forward to going back to Angela's cottage with him
697880,418036680,2019-03-01,226143840,Chanel,Great place to stay.. perfect location  great hospitality  the outdoor area is a bonus.  I will definitely stay there again
697880,432844194,2019-04-05,251566298,Prasanth,If I have to sum it up in one word  Angela is a very kind host. The cottage was spick and span with every thing in order. The check in check out was absolutely smooth  to be honest for us  it came with added generosity to an extent that she even offered dinner at her house. We were welcomed like a family and the stay here felt like home away from home. We are surely going to return.
697880,578301477,2019-12-17,140146679,Ashanti,Great place for price.
697880,584479915,2019-12-30,77923367,Natasha,Highly recommend Angela's garden cottage The place is comfortable  and clean. It has a full kitchen  and it's great to sit outside and enjoy the view when the weather allows it. It's ideal for solo travelers as it's well secured. The hosts were great They were kind  friendly  and helpful they even had some basic items in the fridge upon my arrival They communicated promptly  and I would absolutely stay here again if I return to Cape Town.

The place is perfect just like the photos The tennis court is just lovely for kids and parents to play around. Our kids even played with Martins kids and had a movie night We felt so at home.

1101917,918739297995703085,2023-06-21,120931403,Joe,A wonderful experience in renting Matin and Robyn beautiful house. Wonderful accommodation in the winter and would be even better in warmer weather so one could enjoy the poor  cookouts and the tennis court.  Great location  great accommodation and an outstanding host. What more could you ask for.
697880,596597996,2020-01-23,122505727,Eddy,Angela and Faisel are lovely people. The place is clean  comfortable and you have a private space outside Your privacy is absolutely grarantied. It's in Woodstock  at the first view in the middle of the  Mother City  but we still use UBER to bring us to the highlights of the city. If we go back to CP  it will be there.
697880,602218082,2020-02-06,181948148,Jill,Angela and Faizel are wonderful and very welcoming hosts.    The cottage is in a perfect location with stunning views of the harbourfront and city.    As ex  Capetonians visiting from Australia we enjoyed the easy access to the City Bowl and southern suburbs       Thanks    Mark and Jill
697880,604946117,2020-02-13,38322787,John,A charming private apartment with its own terrace giving fabulous views across the Harbour. Angela and Faizel were very welcoming and attentive throughout our 7 night stay. The apartment was comfortable and well fitted we can recommend it highly.

697880,615041956,2020-03-07,3223988,Elmar  Tina,Das Apartment ist eine einfache aber gemtliche Unterkunft im Walmer Estate  gro genug fr einen oder zwei Personen. Es war sehr sauber und alles war vorhanden  was man zum Leben und Eingewhnen braucht. Der Khlschrank war wirklich gut gefllt  so dass man die ersten tage gar nicht zum  Supermarkt muss. Besonders toll war aber die Gastfreundschaft von Angela und Feizel. Die beiden und ihre erwachsenen Kinder waren wirklich superfreundlich und haben mich sogar zum Essen mit der Familie eingeladen  das ist in knapp zehn Jahren AirBnB noch nie  vorgekommen. Und als mein Mietwagen nicht mehr ansprang Batterie leer hat Feizel schnell einen Bekannten organisiert  der mir Starthilfe gab.  Der Standort in Walmer Estate ist etwas ab vom Schuss  aber man kommt mit Auto und MyCity-Bus schnell in die Stadt oder in die anderen Richtungen Nahe N2 und DeWaal Drive. Ich wrde jederzeit wieder bei den beiden wohnen.
697880,618349809,2020-03-15,169062781,Swantje,Great accomodation at a great location

697880,521563528843500415,2021-12-20,17612688,Per-Anders,A spacious cottage with a good view of the cape town harbor and city. Angela is very friendly and made sure I was happy during my stay. From the locations it's easy to reach nearby Woodstock  Cape Town City center and major roads out of the city.
697880,530212781029967822,2022-01-01,71464047,Altamish,Angela and Faizel are the warmest and most hospitable of hosts. They were really accommodating of our needs on our Christmas holiday  especially with our first born baby. They provided us with a cot as well  which was perfect. The cottage was comfortable and Angela even provided us with great fruit and a stocked fridge on arrival. Sasha  their dog  was kind and such a wonderful pet. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a home away from home.

Highly recommend. Angela is an exceptional host providing top notch service. The cottage is exactly like the photos.

The cottage house was a perfect place for me to rest and recoup in the evenings and have relaxed and quiet mornings. For those without a renal car  the location was just inside the minimum fare for Ubers to places within the city center and surrounding suburbs 36 rand. The view from the terrace is really special. Thank you 
697880,807008767738920293,2023-01-18,58407223,Stacy,I had such a lovely stay. Angela and her husband are such sweet people  I really enjoyed them. It was a quiet space in upper Woodstock but close to the city and plenty of privacy.
697880,811357812855607891,2023-01-24,54036746,Victoria,Full cottage with private terrace so you really have your full privacy. Super nice caring and responsive hosts. Bed is amazing  had my best nights of sleep Neighborhood is safe but a bit further away from the center etc. and not walkable since a few streets away it is less safe. Maybe missing few kitchen items if you are planning on cooking a lot but Im sure Angela would be ready to lend you hers Again  super nice hosts who really care about their guests. Thank you. I will come back
697880,833903819325003084,2023-02-24,8721022,Julian,A great place close to town   but at the same time quiet and peaceful. will definitely come back
697880,839675838960030183,2023-03-04,21074343,Bente,Angela  Feisel and the dog Sasha were really kind and caring hosts  always available and but always giving you private space. The only thing was that the neighborhood could get a little noisy at nights. Would recommend to people wanting a real Cape Town experience
697880,851944061915508255,2023-03-21,405572239,Heiko,Angela and her husband are extremely nice and welcoming. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Everything was perfect

697880,1016531011748427225,2023-11-03,6222320,James,It was a pleasure to stay at Angela's place. The cottage was perfect for a week's stay doing remote working in Cape Town. With a studio kitchen  living  dining room  but also only a short ride into the city centre it was very flexible and convenient. Angela was a friendly and very responsive host who is clearly keen to ensure her guests have an enjoyable stay. It was unfortunately I was very busy and did not have a long time to speak to Angela
697880,1022302397079287089,2023-11-11,365050830,Celeste,This stay was certainly one of the best Airbnb experiences we have had.

They made me feel so at home and were so warm and hospitable. The house is amazing and my area was cleaned weekly  beautiful views and absolutely no issues whatsoever. I will miss staying in Cape Town 
1101917,950633434439027887,2023-08-04,159810492,Steven,This is a great location if you are active...walking trails and forest and close to Cape Town and the constantia wine farms. highly recommend 
1101917,954976660589104803,2023-08-10,2428989,Abbey,Superb Ideal location  dreamy views  modern and well-appointed cottage. There was so much lovely space and hidden gems within the property...add that to Cape Town and you get a winning combination. Our best Airbnb experience out of 40 in various countries. Can't wait to book again but stay for a bit longer.
708351,2950261,2012-11-24,3265726,Cindy,I only spent one night and was very tempted to cancel the other accommodation I had booked. This place is absolutely beautiful and exceptionally good value for money. I highly recommend it and will certainly be staying there again. Thank you Jessica and Jason
708351,3608375,2013-02-22,191469,Jonathan,This is a spacious  peaceful  and very well equipped house in a beautiful location on an inland salt water lake vlei in the southern suburbs of Cape Town.  We stayed there with three adults and two young kids and were really comfortable and uncrowded.  Very helpful with to have laundry facilities and great kitchen.  Jessica was helpful and responsive in fielding our inquiry and coordinating a time and place to meet to exchange the key  and helping with household procedures.  The kids loved feeding the ducks on the vlei  and paddling around on the peddle boat  while we enjoyed the patio and outdoor spaces too.  All in all we could have stayed far longer  and will very likely return on future trips to Cape Town.  Thanks Jessica and Jason
708351,3645785,2013-02-27,3773301,Kirill,Jessica's place is amazing She is very friendly and helpful. We went kayaking right outside the backyard The supermarket was within walking distance and the beach is very close by. Jessica helped us navigate the local area and gave us lots of suggestions. Thanks for everything. We really relaxed at your place and would definitely stay again if we visit South Africa in the future.
708351,3863424,2013-03-22,5277597,Maziar,My family and I stayed their house for one night  and had to move somewhere near as it was booked for the rest of our stay. The house was super fantasticly well equipped  clean  well positioned in a very nice area by Marina Da Gama waters. You have a pedalo and two high quality Kayak boats with life jackets that gives you the option of exploring the waters of the area. On the day of arrival I had to change our arrival time and Jessica did her best to modify her schedule to be at the house on time. If you are planning to come to Cape Town I don't recommend you to stay in Jessica's house only for a part of your stay  but for all the nights in Cape Town The point is that the high quality of the house and kindness of the owners will spoil you and raise your expectations from a self catering house  that you won't enjoy the rest of your stay in other places I'm very happy that I got to know them I know I can book a first class house. I definitely reccomend you to book this place and stay there as many days as you can.
708351,4426096,2013-05-04,189738,Patric  Rags,This place is fantastic A home away from home  as it says  is exactly what this is. The hosts are flexible and helpful.

708351,7448601,2013-09-20,8833992,Soo-Deok,We are a South Korean familya couple with a son and a daughter living in Pretoria. We spent two nights of holidays in the guest house of Jason  Jessica Stainer. The house was a perfect place for my family. Kitchen is perfectly equipped and comfortable for self catering.  Rooms and beds are very clean. Price is very reasonable for this house.  In particular  the kids love this house with the canal and beautiful scenary around.  We appreciate a lot the thoughtfulness and kindness of Jessica.  We spent real happy time in this house.  Thank you so much

1101917,1002025890194208163,2023-10-14,79410867,Natalie,We had a wonderful stay at Martins cottage. There was plenty of room for everyone to relax and the views across the property were beautiful. The daily housekeeping was a real bonus and made our stay even more relaxing. We felt safe at the property and really enjoyed the additional facilities such as the tennis court and the outdoor bbq. The property is also well set up for load shedding and we didnt even notice it while we stayed. The hosts are friendly  very responsive and accommodating  facilitating an early checking for us. Couples travelling together or families with adult children will find this cottage to be especially perfect

1101917,1031770397409695341,2023-11-24,13114575,Dimitri,Martin and Robyn are consummate hosts and they ensured we had a very special holiday throughout our 3-weeks  which flew by. The cottage is the perfect holiday home for families  spacious with 3 bedrooms and an amazing outdoor space meant that we spent much of our time outside taking in the beautiful surroundings. Upper Constantia is absolutely the place to be if you want to visit Cape Town  most parts of the Cape Peninsula are easily accessible  including the city bowl and Camps Bay  and Constantia is full of wineries  restaurants and hiking trails. I cannot recommend this place enough
1101917,1044781440298653839,2023-12-12,16165536,Louisa,We had a wonderful stay at Martin and Robyns place. They provided so many baby stuff which was a big plus for us traveling with a 8 month old. The outdoor area is so lovely and peaceful. Daily housekeeping was also a very nice aspect. We love the area as it is quiet and within reach of all the great wineries and restaurants and just a short trip to the beaches and town. We will be back
1101917,1049807727271391845,2023-12-19,33129107,Angelinka,Martin's place is absolutely fantastic. A peaceful  family friend gem in upper Constantia. Highly recommend  will definitely come back

1111212,10467758,2014-02-20,11680608,Theresa,Sehr schnes Apartment in super Lage. Toller Blick ber die Bucht  speziell bei Sonnenuntergang. Sehr netter Gastgeber. Gerne wieder
1111212,25002391,2015-01-05,12505229,Staffan,Swen har ett fint boende i Gordons bay. Geners lgenhet med en fantastisk utsikt och en fin terass. Swen var hjlpsam och tipsade om vinrutter och annat lmpligt.
1111212,27384742,2015-03-03,16143957,Francine,We loved our 9 day stay in this apartment. There were 3 of us  my husband  myself and my 84 year old mum. We had a great time visiting the wine areas and going into Cape Town 40 mins and Gordon's bay beach is delightful. Swen was very helpful and accommodating and has made the apartment lovely. The views are magnificent any time of the day but sunset was spectacular. Waking up each morning to real coffee was just the icing on the cake
1111212,28169621,2015-03-19,27473218,Robert,Super Appartement mit Top Ausblick von der Terrasse ber die Gordon's Bay. Die Ausstattung war super von den Betten  ber die Kche  bis hin zu den Liegesthlen auf der Terrasse. Der Ausblick bei Sonnenuntergang ber die Bucht ist einfach genial. Ich wrde es jeder zeit wieder buchen. Hatten eine super zeit in der gordon's bay 
1111212,57008161,2015-12-21,22923524,Andrew  Gabrielle,Swen was welcoming and very accommodating to check us in much earlier than the check-in time. The location was ideal with a stunning view from morning to evening from all three rooms opeing up on the terrace however there was a lack of cozyness and a feeling of being at home. The apartment was very spacious but with minimum cooking utensils and facilities eg. tiny fridge  no microwave... and we had to purchase everything from beach towels to toilet paper. I would recommend this apartment to those who are out and about throughout the day and eat out more than staying in.
1111212,59028643,2016-01-06,15489227,Megan,Great location  fantastic views  nice apartment. Lacking aircon tho both bedrooms had a fan which helped a little in the mud day heat. All in all we enjoyed our stay
1111212,61750969,2016-02-08,48133099,Alan,We enjoyed our 4 day stay here very much. Communication with Swen was very easy and an early check in was much appreciated. The apartment was as described  spacious with excellent views over the town and False Bay. Convenient for walking to the townbeaches.
1111212,63577300,2016-02-24,19070097,Kathy,Swen was very available and responsive during the booking process.  His home is in an absolutely gorgeous setting in Gordon's Bay  near Cape Town  South Africa.  The view of the ocean from the outdoor shaded deck is beautiful.  The house is clean  secure and inviting.  The area is host to a number of good restaurants with hearty menus and good wine within walking distance as long as you are OK with hills.  We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this venue.   Thanks Swen
1111212,67124724,2016-03-27,28107107,Ruth,Die Wohnung ist toll mit einem super Ausblick auf die False Bay. Wir haben wunderschne Sonnenuntergnge auf der Terrasse erlebt. Die Zimmer sind sehr schn eingerichtet  die Kche ist sehr gut ausgestattet.  Swen ist ein super Gastgeber.  Alles in allem ein gelungener Start in unseren Sdafrika Urlaub.

1111212,124897945,2017-01-03,43850072,Bert,Swen's 2-bedroom apartment is in a fantastic location above the bay with an amazing view overlooking the bay  beach and mountains  but only a few minutes walk away from the centre of Gordon's Bay with its numerous restaurants. The great  huge sun terrace overlooking the bay is amazing. The apartment is well equipped and was very clean  a place wher we felt very comfortable  and Swen was a great host  friendly and most helpful.
1111212,136046985,2017-03-08,102208724,Nicole,Wir verbrachten zwei tolle Wochen in Swen's Wohnung. Die Terrasse ist einfach super. Die Lage seines Hauses ist sehr schn. Morgens sieht man als erstes das Meer  die Bucht und die wunderschnen Berge. Man ist schnell zu Fuss in Gordons Bay und die Leute sind nett. Swen war ein kompetenter  freundlicher Gastgeber und hat uns sehr nett betreut  ohne dass man den Eindruck hatte beobachtet zu werden. Danke Swen
1111212,139405524,2017-03-25,33258757,Christoph,....  we had a really good time in Swens flat  great view  a lot of space  nice communication ... thanks a lot ... hope to see you again ....

708351,42595728,2015-08-14,3831754,Teresa,This is a great place - location  details  amenities  and host Jessica was so thoughtful in helping us figure out arrangements  being flexible  and just going above and beyond to make us feel like we had a friend in a new city. The house was so comfortable  beyond how it was even described. Lots of extras that made us feel right at home. The kitchen had everything we needed and more. The house layout was ideal for evenings in where the adults could hang out around the fireplace once the kids were asleep. Safe  secure  and quiet. If we are ever back in Cape Town this will be the first place we will look to for our stay.
708351,52830707,2015-11-02,29216828,Stephen,From the time we arrived Jessica was most helpful and had the house ready for us and although in a few areas it could do with a little refreshing  the location and outlook  together with the local wildlife made our stay really enjoyable.  The property Meg our needs well and was safe and convenient as a base to travel from.   Thanks Jason  Jessica
708351,66665146,2016-03-24,49803251,Annette,Awesome place  great house and very nice and kind hosts. If we ever come back to Cape Town we sure know a place to stay at. Full and anbsolute recommendation.

Everything was clean and you felt very secured. There is a bus station only a few meters away and you are in the cbd or waterfront within less than a ten minutes drive. You may cook your own stuff in the kitchen having a nice chat with astrid. You also get to know her two lovely cats or join the view from the balcony. My boyfriend and i would really like to recommend this place to anybody who wants to have a great stay in cape town
1144728,8299058,2013-10-24,8508802,Denis,The room was great. Everything was ready for my stay  bed and fresh towels. Breakfast was amazing yoghurt with fruits and muesli. The apartment looks great. Astrid knows very well cape town and gave me plenty of good tips. I highly recommend this stay.
1144728,8932990,2013-11-26,9766316,Jennifer,Every part of my stay at Astrid's was lovely. Her sunny and clean apartment with two cats  beautiful decor  many plants and great views was an oasis after a busy week at work. I also loved the Woodstock neighborhood - it was a great departure from the tourist trail  and yet easy to reach from the center of Cape Town by bus or taxi. The perfect place to land for a few days.
708351,79718748,2016-06-13,51808858,Mizpah,we just needed to get directions but Jessica and Jason were super. Jessica was a star So welcoming. The house had every thing wre needed. It was wonderful to be able to race on Zandvlei and be able to recover and restore for next race in comfort and safety.  Thanks so much  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  
708351,114158839,2016-11-16,41912565,Ian,Very nice place  just a few dead insects in bathroom  but quickly cleaned up. Jessica was very helpful
708351,116131196,2016-11-28,31299028,Celynn,This is a very special place that brings serenity and calm. The water access and views are wonderful. It is a comfortable home perfect for a quiet get away or for a larger group wanting to relax and recharge but still offering great place to entertain.
708351,116749376,2016-12-03,41236448,Homely Hosts,Very beautifully situated  good communication  our expectations were met or exceeded. Thank you
708351,141875929,2017-04-05,68427160,Frances,This is a lovely home in a beautiful spot on in the Marina da Game.  The kids loved the pedal and the canoes.  It is very peaceful  and very well equipped  near to shops  Muizenberg beach and restaurants.  We are a family of five and the house was perfect for us.
708351,184758591,2017-08-20,28508639,Renet,Wow what an amazing place  on the river close to everything. Perfect for big family. Thanks so much  would definitely recommend it to my friends.
708351,207043015,2017-10-28,117636031,Jrgen,Wir hatten eine gute Zeit in Muizenberg. Ca. eine halbe Autostunde  whrend der Rush Hour auch mal eine gute Stunde oder mehr nach Cape Town. Die bergabe durch jemanden drittes lief soweit problemlos. Leider muss ich aber erwhnen  dass die Bilder im Inserat nicht das widerspiegeln was wir angetroffen haben. Das Mbiliar  auch auf der Terasse  und die Bder knnten mal wieder erneurt werden. Auch die Algen im Wasser vom Fluss knnten beseitigt werden. Wir waren 3 Wochen in Sdafrika unterwegs  hatten 12 Stationen bzw. Unterknfte. Preislich lagen sie alle ungefhr gleich. Leider hatten wir hier am meisten das Gefhl  das es weniger um den Gast geht  sonder mehr ums Geld  schade
708351,249488742,2018-04-02,157115467,Maria Stella,Being the house on the lagoon I don't think it is too safe for small children unless they are under strict supervision. Otherwise I  have only to praise about everything. I spent 4 very happy days with my overseas guests.
1144728,9365324,2013-12-24,9008775,Heiko,We have stayed at Astrids accomodation for 5 days and we definitely recommend this appartment. The appartment is very nice decorated the pictures don't lie and Astrid was a very nice host and was alsways very helpful.
1144728,10600385,2014-02-27,10281311,Jeroen En Amarins,Astrid is a warm  friendly and inspiring person and we enjoyed lively conversations with her. We are happy to have stayed with her when we were in Cape Town and will surely return when we are lucky enough to visit Cape Town again. Great apartment  with a view. Wholeheartedly recommended
1144728,10786190,2014-03-07,12561104,Fleur,We had an amazing stay with Astrid. Her apartment is beautifully decorated and the bedroom is very spacious. The neighboorhood is very safe and there are lots of nice restaurants  coffeebars and shops. Astrid was the perfect host  she told us everything about Capetown  and the muesli we got for breakfast was the best of all
708351,425409743,2019-03-18,92678234,Michael,A very spacious  comfortable  clean  and extremely well equipped house. Jessica was very hospitable  meeting us in person to show us around and introduce us to the many things the house has to offer  like a pair of kayaks and a pedalo The house also offers an amazing outdoor area with a built in BBQ  which was a perfect place to be at sunset. Muizenberg beach was only a five minute drive  which was great for surfing and had a number of good bars and restaurants. I would highly recommend staying and would certainly stay again if I ever came back to the area.
708351,441893887,2019-04-22,100409277,Christin,Jessica and her family was sweet and warm. The appartement is perfect - surroundings even better. I will be back next time Im travelling to SA

708351,480219247,2019-07-02,84279880,Melissa,What a lovely experience staying at Jason  Jessicas place. Its a beautiful home  in a lovely setting. They have really spent time thinking of all the extra items and special touches that go into making the home as unique as it is. The house is very well equipped with everything you could possibly need - great for long stays and especially nice for foodies who enjoy nicely appointed kitchens. Best of all  are the wonderful hosts... what a pleasure  joy it was getting to meet Jessica. We look forward to meeting again
708351,486101576,2019-07-12,138935518,Eugene,The pictures are a perfect depiction of the beautiful home Jess and Jason have. I only wish I had more time to completely enjoy all of the amenities that were available. But we did get to enjoy the peace and tranquility the house offered. As hosts Jess is an extremely attentive and a wonderful person. Very friendly  easy to communicate with  and very flexible. I look forward to staying with them again if I am lucky enough to ever get a booking again.
708351,489583155,2019-07-17,22274155,Isabelle,Incredible house  feet into the water. Much space  fully equipped  perfectly cleaned and the cherry on the cake is the boat you can enjoy just at the bottom of the house. Lovely birds to see.
708351,506011700,2019-08-10,270750818,Chloe,You want to stay there  and you want to stay for at the very least 3 nights This place is stunning  very well located and you are litteraly on the lake There is a lot of space  Jessica has very good taste when it comes to furnitures and everything is there if you want to go and enjoy yourself on the lake Incredible stay We were 5 and had a blast Thank you so much

We have travelled and seen different hotels and guest houses around the globe  but Jessica' place is a cut above them all  its exquisite. Equiped with all that we could ever need in all the rooms. Tumble drier  braai area  games for all  full dstv bouquet  beautiful sunset views and beautiful flowers. The little pedal boat and kayaks were the best  we really enjoyed peddling with my daughter. It has been a memorable trip. We absolutely recommend this place. It was home away from home. Keep up the great hospitality.
708351,704561120,2020-10-28,162982013,Kim,Jessica's place is a little piece of paradise over the lake. Very well equipped  everything you could need  and very spacious. It's a great place to escape city life and live that lake life

708351,488106302150938745,2021-11-04,28323999,Stephen,Loved the place  it was hard to leave. Only disappointment was that the waterways were closed so we couldnt use them  but nothing the host could do about that. Definitely recommend Jessicas place for short or long stays.

1144728,11427237,2014-04-02,11121263,Katrin,I stayed 3 weeks with Astrid and what can I say...it was just perfect The flat is very beautyful located in Woodstock  which is really nice to stay. Astrid is perfect in recomending things to do outside of the very touristic stuff. I highly recommend this place  I always felt very welcome
1144728,12727672,2014-05-09,3688202,Rachel,Staying with Astrid was like staying with the perfect housemate. I enjoyed every minute spent with her. She is such a lovely soul  caring  interesting and wise. Her apartment is gorgeous. It is full of sunlight  and the interior decoration is inspirational. She also has two super cats  one of which spent every night with me curled up on my bed. When I visit Cape Town again  there is absolutely no doubt in my mind as to where I will stay...with Astrid  of course 
1144728,13195710,2014-05-21,2508259,Kate,Astrid is great and her apartment is lovely. I had a brilliant stay and was made to feel really at home. I was in SA for work  but Astrid very graciously didn't mind me lurking around the house when I had to work  or cooking in the evening with her pots and pans. Super comfortable bed  good location especially for the Biscuit Mill on Saturdays and wonderful view from the balcony. She knows a lot about Cape Town's history and development and how to get around. And the breakfasts are delicious - I'm missing all the pineapple already
1144728,14086691,2014-06-11,7680919,Amanda,Staying with Astrid was a wonderful experience. Her place is beautiful  filled with eclectic art  lush plants and amazing light  not to mention two lovely cats. Astrid is herself very hospitable and friendly  and was incredibly helpful during my stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her place to anyone visiting Cape Town. Thanks Astrid
1144728,18891749,2014-09-02,18606609,Megan,Staying with Astrid was great Beautiful  stylish apartment conveniently a block from the MyCiti bus line in Woodstock  which is a very hip area with new restaurants opening and close to the Biscuit Mill market. Very comfortable accommodation and friendly  fascinating host with lots of insights about the area. She provided muesli  tea and fruit for breakfast which was really nice. Two cute cats too
1144728,19621307,2014-09-15,11772418,Linye,Astrid is so nice and gives me a lot of suggestion. And also the apartment is awesome  very quiet  clean  and stylish  I hope I can come back again soon. Thank you my friend

1144728,20477069,2014-09-29,5833803,Cara,Astrid is a generous and thoughtful host  and a great conversation partner too. The block is well located  and her flat is exceptional - bright and beautiful. I would recommend staying with Astrid to anyone.
1144728,20865948,2014-10-06,6559821,Julia,Astrid ist die perfekte Gastgeberin und ihre Wohnung ideal gelegen  um Kapstadt zu entdecken. Die Wohnung im trendigen Viertel Woodstock ist nicht nur wunderschn eingerichtet  sondern hat auch eine umwerfende Aussicht auf die Stadt  den Hafen und Signal Hill. Astrid hat mir mit vielen Tipps und tatkrftiger  nicht selbstverstndlicher  Untersttzung  zu einem sehr guten Start in Kapstadt verholfen. Ich wrde jedem meiner Freunde empfehlen  bei ihr zu buchen und es selbst auch sofort wieder tun. Eine bessere Unterkunft lsst sich in Kapstadt nicht finden.
1144728,21367274,2014-10-15,22365963,Carsten,This was our first time using airbnb and if everywhere is as nice as Astrid's then I don't think we would ever need another hotel again Astrid was the perfect host  she had thought of everything and was great to chat to. The flat is lovely  Astrid is a very stylish lady. The room is really nice and the bed very comfortable. We loved the area  plenty of cafes etc within walking distance. We would definitely recommend staying with Astrid and I am quite sure we will be seeing her again.
1144728,21945518,2014-10-27,3342696,Sara  Chris,Astrid is a very kind host and welcomed us at home when we arrived. She gave us great advices to get around town.

1144728,23220516,2014-11-25,4103099,Verena,We totally recommend Astrid and her beautiful Apartment in woodstock. We really felt at home. Astrid is a very helpful  warm and hospitable person  who additionally speaks german fluently. She knows the nice places to go to in Cape Town and has as an architect a good eye for furnishing  we were amazed And the view from the balcony is great We got muesli with different fresh fruits every morning. The area woodstock is up and coming  but not to touristic up to now. We felt safe around the apartment  though its better to have a car or take the bus just around the corner to get to the city center as it is not safe everywhere. When we come back to CT we would totally come back to Astrid Thanks a lot
1144728,23855248,2014-12-12,9088740,Femke,Astrid's apartment is thoughtful nicely and attractively decoraded. Astrid her self is realy sweet and affectionate woman. She make you feel welcome and at home. This is one of our top air bb's
1144728,25978905,2015-01-31,3172168,Julie,My mother and I had a wonderful stay in Cape Town and Astrid's apartment was perfect for our mini vacation.  Astrid was very welcoming  kind and caring throughout our stay.  I felt very relaxed and at home here.  Passion fruit for breakfast every morning was a true delight and the freshly brewed coffee was great. The apartment has all the necessities needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay.  There is a bus stop very close by that takes you straight to the city center and has great links all over the city.  There is also an amazing market nearby called the Biscuit Mill which is 'must go' when staying at this apartment.  Next time I am in Cape Town I will definatley stay in Astrid's beautiful home.
1144728,28080705,2015-03-17,26806426,Wiebke,We had a wonderful time at Astrids place. She welcomed us very warmly and shared her knowledge about Cape Town.  We loved her flat and all the lovely details within  including her gorgeous cats. Astrid prepared a very nice breakfast which was a perfect start into the day.  Woodstock is a fantastic area to stay with friendly people  not many tourists and nice restaurants and the Old Biscuit Mill nearby. We highly recommend Astrid's place and would love to come back ourselves.
1144728,28355414,2015-03-22,488143,Mara,Loved staying in this flat. Astrid was practically like my own concierge service and was so helpful to informing me of the ins and outs of Cape Town. I only stayed a few nights but it felt like home.

1144728,42799319,2015-08-15,9466925,Trevor,Astrid was a fabulous host. Very accommodating  easy to communicate with  and happens to be the owner of a wonderful apartment. The apartment had everything I needed on my business trip  had a stunning view of Lion's Head mountain and has a variety of plants throughout the place which add unique character. Very quiet building  with solid security and  great location. The flat was within walking distance to an amazing Italian seafood  great indian  and even a hip bar with good beer selection.

1144728,50479904,2015-10-12,13658864,Elke,We had a wonderful time at Astrids cosy apartment in trendy Woodstock. Plenty of space  sunny balcony and in walking distance to the Old Biscuit Mill with the gorgious neighborgoods market every Saturday. Astrid is perfect host and took good care of us. I would  only recommend to bring a car  since taxi drivers have a hard time finding the place.
1144728,53626600,2015-11-10,18298599,Nina,Astrid's home is sweetly decorated and it was lovely to meet her on arrival and we really appreciated all her restaurant recommendations. The location is in the up and coming area of Woodstock and in walking distance of the fun and vibrant Old Biscuit Mill and a nice coffee shop - that said it is a bit too edgy to walk around at night by yourself so a car is recommended. We did however feel very safe in Astrid's apartment. The bedrooms were very comfy and the balcony offered amazing views.
1144728,55200702,2015-11-29,31331224,Franziska,Wir waren zwei Wochen in Astrids wunderschner und perfekt gelegener Wohnung und haben uns von Anfang an wie zu Hause gefhlt. Die Betten sind sehr bequem  die Zimmer sehr gemtlich eingerichtet und der Blick vom Balkon auf Lionshead und Hafen war jeden Abend ein Traum.

708351,1125222408102362438,2024-04-01,457436600,Mark,Jessicas place is a very special slice of Cape Town. The photos do not do the home justice  as its rare you find a space that has multiple special spots to sit and just relax in. It fell like a home away from home with an extremely well stocked kitchen. I hope to come back again soon
708351,1146280304269174811,2024-04-30,406694203,Olivia,Beautiful place with stunning views of the mountains and canal. Very peaceful. Thanks to Jessica for her lovely hospitality.

1144728,57703844,2015-12-28,7693697,Monique,Astrid's apartment is exquisitely decorated - a gem in the trendy Woodstock neighbourhood with views of both the mountain and the sea. An oasis of gorgeous plants Astrid was a really accommodating host and we had a wonderful stay.
1144728,58523280,2016-01-03,3474289,Marie,Astrid's apartment is lovely. It is spacious and filled with light and all those little details just make you feel at home.

1144728,60517079,2016-01-24,21114126,Alexander,The apartment is beautifully furnished and Astrid is charming and helpful. Woodstock is filled with interesting shops and restaurants and is only a short cab ride from the attractions of Observatory. If you're looking for a more bohemian quarter of town then Astrid's place is a perfect base. Just bear in mind that Central Cape Town this ain't which is why we liked it.
1144728,61416799,2016-02-04,1679673,Nina,Astrid hat eine wunderschne Wohnung. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefhlt und werden defintiv wiederkommen.

The apartment is beautiful - a home away from home. Her decor is exceptional - full of inspiring art pieces and a very impressive array of pot plants The area was perfect for our needs - very central and convenient you don't need to worry about getting stuck in crazy rush hour traffic. We discovered a great deli down the road called Salisbury's who are open every day and have wonderful lunches and salads. All in all it was a perfect work  holiday getaway.

1144728,68039689,2016-04-01,63327916,Susanne,The accomodation was like in the description and very nice  clean and comfortable.

We could walk to three different supermarkets and a dozen wonderful restaurants.  Our favorite walk each morning was along the promenade in either direction for miles along the ocean.  The views of the ocean  boulders  Table Mountain and Lions Peak were incredible  The host was more than accommodating to our every need.  Housekeeping every week was a real plus.  Cape Town is amazing and we were more than happy at this wonderful condo.

731764,863574893445827064,2023-04-06,34336200,Shirley,Chantals place is a tranquil Sea Point home in a perfect position. The wonderful trees to west of the apartment  block the late afternoon sun so the balcony is perfect for soaking up the ocean views. Easy access to local shops  restaurants and the Camps Bay to VA Waterfront promenade make this an enjoyable home.
731764,927377081805426753,2023-07-03,77076633,Bruce,Chantals place was a great place to stay while visiting Cape Town.  Its close to lots of excellent bars  cafes and restaurants in Sea Point.  It is about a one hour walk along the seafront into the heart of Cape Town.
731764,1002793184788326595,2023-10-15,309581500,Albert,Dit was een absoluut top appartement. In de details zie je dat alles goed is afgewerkt. Prachtig smaakvol ingericht  fantastisch uitzicht  ideale locatie  150 meter van Regentstreet waar de supermarkten  restaurants en winkeltjes te vinden zijn.

Thanks for taking so good care of us BRAD.
731882,29221091,2015-04-05,16725943,Kristie,This is a great place for two people in a perfect location. Beautiful view We slept with the windows wide open every night There is as secured  gated parking spot  housekeeping comes each day  mini bar if you would like to purchase any items  and a safe in the closet should you want to store any valuables while you're away. Walking distance to the waterfront and to the hopon hopoff bus stop down by the lighthouse which is the best way to get around the city and explore.  The only two things I would mention for travelers. . . 1. There is a fee to have wifi. It's fairly inexpensive but still important to note. And 2. You need to pick the keys up a few minutes away from the actual apartment which is easy if you have a car but could be a nuisance if you're in a cab our other form of transportation and hauling luggage around. The people we met with to pick up keys were extremely pleasant and Chantal is very responsive and helpful when you have questions  Beautiful place to stay in a beautiful town
731882,347375808,2018-11-11,49440791,Desme,The flat is perfectly located. The only airbnb that I know that comes with daily cleaning service. Truly enjoyed our stay there.

1182416,53898916,2015-11-14,5266703,Melissa,We had a great stay at Brad and Cheryl's place in Long Street. The apartment is well stocked  and is very comfortable. It is exactly as described and more central location  beautiful and safe. Brad and Cheryl are excellent hosts. They respond quickly  answering all questions and anticipation any questions we may have regarding our stay.

1182416,229149231,2018-01-22,24229897,Joanna,The apartment was located on Long street  literally a 30 second walk from the Hop On Hop Off tour bus stop and next to an awesome Ethiopian restaurant and coffee shop.  The neighborhood was a little on the sketchy side but there are so many awesome places close by that I would totally stay there again if I ever go back to Cape Town. We were met by Brad's wife who was super nice and helpful. She even sent the bag of souvenirs that we left at their place to our next location in SA. We are super grateful for that.
1182416,240116390,2018-03-04,398267,Kristen,Ive been to Cape Town 4 times now and Brads place is the best AirBnB for location  size  walkability  everything. Youre in the heart of the city  with parking included  and an awesome view of Lions Head Would definitely stay here again

1182416,272866216,2018-06-04,115250363,Mayanka,Brad's spot is the perfect Cape Town location centrally located on Long Street. We were able to quickly get to destinations like Table Mountain and the VA Waterfront. Brad and his wife Cheryl were very friendly and responsive to messages and Cheryl gave us some amazing suggestions for dinner Mojo Market. The apartment itself is very clean and feels safe because of the security in the lobby. It's on Long Street  so you're close to great restaurants and bars  but far enough away that it's never too noisy. We loved it and will definitely be back
1182416,297538276,2018-07-28,134527043,Theodora,The appartment is located close to the center of town. Better not walk alone at night. Good value for money.

1182416,537878594,2019-09-29,296058288,Athenkosi,Good space for some time out in the city. Clean and very modern space. Enjoyed our stay here.
1182416,628615176,2020-06-09,221182,Rob,THE PLACE a two-bedroom well-appointed apartment. very comfortable beds in both bedrooms. There's a view of Lion's Head from the balcony. Netflix Smart TV  but the normally available internet wasn't working I was the first person to use the place in months due to the lockdown and had booked last-minute. There was a very deep bathtub with separate shower. I had wanted several long soaks since this is a stressful time  so I had especially asked about the tub before I got there. There is a family-size refrigerator in the kitchen  as well as a dishwasher. There are airconheating units. LOCATION Long Street  in Cape Town CBD. Normally bustling most of the time  but in this era of COVID  eerily quiet. THE HOST Brad seemed nice  and got everything set up on a moment's notice  which was great. ADDITIONAL TIPS if you smoke outside  move the table away from the fans for the airconheating or the smoke will fill up the place. Book this place when the city is up and running again  or even if you want a quiet getaway the way things are now.

1182416,879594443104601996,2023-04-28,88584551,Lamiae,Booking with Brad was a breeze His friendly and warm communication made us feel at ease from the beginning. We arrived for a late check in so we were unfortunately unable to directly meet Brad  still he gave us very clear directions on how to get started. We were greeted by the very nice and helpful security of the building. The flat itself is spotless and modern it is big and more than equipped with anything our family of four needed. The location is perfect  it's safe and it's walking distance from restaurants and a super souvenir Market. We would definitely retun back to Brad's flat if we have the chance to visit Cape Town in the future. Thank you Brad for your kindness and hospitality.

1191976,408731430,2019-02-05,2174233,Yasmin,Lovely stay. Clean  safe and very well located. Chantals quick responses to questions were really appreciated.
1191976,411012789,2019-02-11,26571421,Seb,Lovely studio spot  in great a location   with fantastic finishes and it  could just be the cleanest place in Cape Town. Feels like a quiet Oceanside getaway  but is right near the sea point bustle  a quick ride to the city bowl  and an easy walk to the waterfront. We loved staying in the flat as it was super comfy and had everything we needed  not least of all amazing seafront views. Kinda place thats hard to leave Thanks for a great stay 
1191976,413809139,2019-02-18,145857554,Deepak,This is an excellent apartment. The views are unbeatable. My wife and I found the location to be very safe. Check-in process was very easy and straightforward. The apartment has great stylish touches. The wooden floor by the window was very unique and appreciated. We used the Nespresso machine for coffee every day and sat at the kitchen island. The kitchen was stocked with all the cookware  dishes and cutlery that you could need. The bathroom was great. I cannot say enough great things about this space. I'm very happy we stayed here and would definitely stay here again. Daily housekeeping really sets this place apart. The only drawback was the lack of air conditioning which may be a problem for some. My wife found the apartment to be too warm on some nights  but I found it to be comfortable. There is a ceiling fan above the bed that I found to be more than adequate to keep cool at night.
1191976,416130833,2019-02-24,129827968,Johnny,great view and neat room

1191976,571367850,2019-12-01,118123945,Diane,The host was very flexible and the view was amazing. I would definitely stay here again if I go back to Cape Town. Just keep in mind that theres no AC  which isnt really needed because the waterfront is cool  but also keep in mind that there are mosquitoes so you cannot keep the windows open at night. The room was very clean and someone came by everyday to clean the place. The decor is very modern and chic. I loved that they provide nespresso and all the kitchen supplies needed to cook or cut fruits  etc. Location was amazing Thanks again for everything Chantal
1191976,578311113,2019-12-17,49685771,Jyoti,Place was perfect. Just as the pictures. Check-in and out was easy. The housekeeping daily is definitely an additional benefit. Would stay there again.

We were not disappointed  however some details were not quite what we had imagined. Nevertheless  we had a great time in Camps Bay and our stay in Msangasanga was absolutely hassle-free. Thank you.

732339,735057410,2021-02-28,258901261,Conville,Lovely flat to use as a spring board to explore the mother city.
732339,757664866,2021-05-13,211353597,Jackie,Had a great stay ... a cosy home away from home in a beautifully peaceful suburb. If you want to break away from the city rush and need some peace and quiet  this is the place to be at.
732339,764091499,2021-05-30,236710823,Lepota,It was nice  peaceful and easy to find.  the place also offers nice view from the bedroom window looking at a green park
1318508,62621578,2016-02-15,22157640,Kimberly,I had an excellent stay at Christophe's cottage. It's a cozy  clean  private guest cottage attached to his main home. Great location near the beaches and restaurants. Christophe was very hospitable and invited me to have dinner with him and his family one of the nights.
732339,470759760315719613,2021-10-11,231240050,Mikhayla,Great home away from home
1318508,116176436,2016-11-28,104969601,Rick,This place is not what the photos and description attempt to portray. It is not charming at all It is small  dirty and the furnishings and utensils are totally lacking This place should rent for 500 Rand per night  no more. That is once they control the ant infestation throughout
732339,500476694687806131,2021-11-21,125396464,Alwyn,Definitely a place to stay for business or studies.
1318508,124923381,2017-01-03,2206554,Travis,Really enjoyed our stay - Christophe was a great host  very accommodating and helpful with tips  questions  etc. The location is great would recommend this area over Camp's Bay for example  and just a walk to the beach  great shops  restaurants. Would highly recommend and stay again
732339,509929154068714226,2021-12-04,166942973,Emmanuel,Smooth communication throughout. Very clean place.
1318508,126368312,2017-01-11,6436669,Adam,Good location and apartment - basement unit  but with walkout little backyard
732339,515036627202273169,2021-12-11,370898344,Andrew,Great place to stay if you have business to do  in Belville or want to be close to wine routes. Spotlessly clean. Very convenient and has everything needed. Very well equipped to deal with multiple charges for electronics with a number of power-points including two prongs. Comfortable bed. Decent linen. Will definitely be back
1318508,147537654,2017-04-27,76565207,Maximiliane,Christopher was very accommodating and helpful. Thanks again.
732339,528014716111295087,2021-12-29,437252919,Welex,Wonderful place to stay
1318508,566492426416245983,2022-02-20,32677530,Brian,The location is really good. Parking was easy and the place is spacious. Reasonable value for money and recommended for this reason. It feels secure and was quiet. I was happy to spend almost 3 weeks there.
732339,536689436026491375,2022-01-10,260777827,Jaclisse Lorene,What a lovely place The apartment was sparkling and had everything we needed. Otto was great and super accommodating host. Had a wonderful stay and we would definitely recommend.
732339,541024389151344948,2022-01-16,333335108,Geetah,Place exceeded my expectations  and enjoyed my stay thoroughly.
1318508,1031791005583784435,2023-11-24,539707245,Michael,Communication with Kim she looks after the house was good and the location was ideal for a lot of activities. However  there were many dead ants in the flat. The washingmaschine was full of hair inside unfortunately  even after the housekeeper cleaned it  so I had to clean it myself. It was unfortunate  but other than than  the flat is big and has a nice terrace.
732339,546883969472994729,2022-01-24,228186167,Lizette,Excellent place  compact yet spacious  modern finishes  clean  great location
1318508,1067406100593955283,2024-01-12,52312038,Caro,Es begann damit die Unterkunft zu finden. Die Adresse lautet Zahl A. Wir klingelten erst mal bei den Nachbarn. Er hat dazu nichts in der Check in Information geschrieben. Vor Ort war die Wohnung sehr sehr dreckig. Ameisen in Kche  am Bett  im Wohnzimmer. Im Garten trafen wir auf eine Maus. Der Boden war nicht gewischt und in den Ecken berall Spinnweben. Die Wohnung ist Souterrain. Deutlich dunkler als auf den Fotos dargestellt. Der Garten ist nicht gepflegt. An einer Ecke im Wohnzimmer ist ein Wasserschaden an der Decke. Christophe war jedoch so kulant und hat uns komplett stornieren lasse mit voller Rckerstattung. Was traurig ist Fehler wurden bei Airbnb gemeldet und keine Stunde spter war das gleiche Apartment unter anderer Person wieder online hochgeladen. Scheint als htte er kein Interesse daran die Fehler auszubessern.
1318508,1072366757850097312,2024-01-19,354857067,Chelsea,Great stay
732339,554833666927914550,2022-02-04,49970722,Louis,Really good and comfortable stay. Everything was well positioned and nice touches.
732339,570010320864574372,2022-02-25,278136286,Oddysseus,Great host peaceful place and great location great if you travelling for business .Otto is a great host i had no issues and communication was smooth. The place is really beautiful and is suitable for business and for holiday.
1318508,1118683759329006115,2024-03-23,205460069,Liesel,Lovely little place but not the best value for money with no save parking no netflix or dstv. Cleaning was billed at a high amount but no cleaning or new bedding  towels in 10 day stay.
1331613,7641670,2013-09-28,2727653,Nicholas,Great place  Great location. We were a family of 3 2 Adults 1 child but this house could have fit at least double that. If you want a central place in Cape Town  pls do book with Wendy. They are just such lovely people.
732339,571545259553956772,2022-02-27,232028762,Lg,great views  quiet and has everything you need in a house really
1331613,7914449,2013-10-08,2727653,Nicholas,Stayed with wendy twice so please read the first review
732339,580174259497740550,2022-03-11,194531530,Venetia,Otto is very welcoming. The apartment is very neat and clean and pleasant to the eye. If you wish to cook  please ask Otto to supply you with some bowls andor dishes as there aren't any in the kitchen. The pans are also not in great shape  but other than that  it is a lovely place with a stunning view out onto the open areas. The dam is a short walk away and the ducks keep you entertained.
732339,582437884754650147,2022-03-14,36422301,Carel,Excellent host. Very tidy  clean and fully fitted unit. My parents had a brilliamt stay and enjoyed it very much. Keep up the great work
1331613,9487074,2013-12-31,1349753,Lindsey,We were very happy with both our accommodations and the hospitality of our hosts. We arrived very late Christmas Eve  but still received a warm welcome and Wendy had thoughtfully stocked us with basic groceries and also holiday sweets Everything was very comfortable  spacious and attractive--worked well for our family of four. Only caution is for anyone with physical challenges  as one of the bedrooms is up a set of steep stairs and a second down a step or two. The area was pleasant and well located even with only taxis for 6 days--we visited Groot Constantia  Robben Island  Kirstenbosch  and were picked up for a wonderful tour of the Wine Country. Wendy and her husband are great hosts.
1331613,10246515,2014-02-09,10904838,Frans,Our family had a wonderful stay at Wendy and Walters house in Rondebosch. With three kids the space and the little pool were really nice. We also made good use of the outside braai We stayed for a week and it was the perfect location to explore Cape Town. It was good value for money.  the Pannekoek family.
1331613,10343859,2014-02-15,7377683,Andy,A very pleasant and relaxing place to stay with excellent hosts who are warm  friendly and extremely helpful.  A great stay.
1331613,10618064,2014-02-28,11041190,Steffen,Wendy is a very pleasant and caring person. She organized a brand new cot for our little baby we had a good time in a lovely accommodation. Absolutely recommendable
1331613,10970288,2014-03-15,8079338,Peter,A deceptively large and comfortable oasis in Rondebosch. Wendy and her husband were warm  welcoming and super helpful to my colleagues and I.
1331613,13492970,2014-05-28,13560925,Shafrin,The accommodation is very spacious and homely  perfect for 6 of us. Wendy was quick to respond and very helpful since the day we contacted her. She guided us to her place which was easy to find and the checking in process was very smooth. The house is very well equipped and looks exactly like the lovely pictures provided on the review. It is also centrally located to major tourist attractions and close to supermarkets and restaurants including the factory outlet stores. The house itself is a perfect retreat after a long day exploring Cape Town. Wendy and Walter are wonderful hosts  very welcoming and friendly  which made our trip to Cape Town a memorable one. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Cape Town.
1331613,15058991,2014-07-01,16154021,Jane,Karen's house is so amazing We really enjoyed these three days when we stayed in Karen's house It is warm and comfortable Everybody are very nice And also  we love the breast fast Thanks   all of you  Karen Hope see you again
1331613,21940829,2014-10-27,1459699,Barbara,I didnt stay myself at Wendy's house  but my family did. All of them  grandma  aunt and uncles  said great things about Wendy. They required me to leave her a review on their behalf.  Wendy was an extraordinary host  going above and beyond to make them feel at home.  She provided all support  and took care of all the little things. Just as an example of her kindness   they said she prepared a fruit basket to welcome them  she helped with a cellphone they needed. They really appreciated these gestures and many many others during their trip Wendy  thanks for taking care of my family
1331613,22332525,2014-11-03,270504,Tracy,The Rondebosch location was a fine location to access Capetown affordably by taxi  then return to a quiet  peaceful  nicely appointed home. We had all we needed and the place afforded three adults spaces to be together as well as our privacy and own en suite baths. Wendy and Walter were consummate hosts. They guided us in the right direction for our Garden Route tour  and assisted us in making plans for a safari. We enjoyed spending time chatting over a glass of wine and learning about life in their country. I can't say enough about our stay  Highly recommend.
732339,639667135502263685,2022-06-01,410286772,Tendai,Otto is very professional and responsive. Really enjoyed my stay at the lovely apartment
1331613,22626043,2014-11-10,4177294,Allyson,Wendy is very friendly and gave us a warm welcome with a quick tour around the place. She has also put up some useful information about the apartment and has even left pamphlets about restaurants in the vicinity. The apartment was clean  very comfortable and had everything there that you might need for a self-cater stay. The apartment is also easy to find and close to highway access. Loved the stay there  only wish it could have been for longer.
1331613,24294006,2014-12-25,20439816,Taneal,Wendy was extremely welcoming and made us feel right at home. We were a group of six and had pleanty of space to spread out. The place is very charming and relaxing. It was a great location for seeing all the sites. We would stay there again.
1331613,24457398,2014-12-29,11215169,Travis,A comfortable cosy place close to the city and table mountain. Wendy and Walter were very welcoming and helpful. We had amazing weather so everyday was amazing
1331613,24579573,2014-12-31,4852872,Thomas Og Dorthe,Rigtig fin bolig. Meget tt p Capetown. Wendy var hurtig til at svare og eget hjlpsom. Vi var glade for poolen. Pnt og rent.
1331613,25940129,2015-01-30,26391759,Darryn,Outstanding hosts in a very quiet well equipped house  we enjoyed a fantastic stay and will most certainly rent the place again in the future when going to Cape Town
1331613,28425588,2015-03-23,24818970,Stefanie,Wendy was such a nice host We would love to stay at hers again.
1331613,28967874,2015-04-01,29921578,Shanta,We really enjoyed our stay at Wendy's accommodation in Rondebosch. The place was nice and clean and Wendy was a lovely host -
1331613,29654526,2015-04-11,23480675,Claire,We were made extremely welcome.  Was like home away from home  Thank you to Wendy and Walter they made us feel extremely welcome.  Lovely neighbourhood  central access to all areas  felt safe always.  Lovely people  lovely place  thank you
1331613,31147431,2015-05-02,6081276,Richard,Wendy was very welcoming and the house was comfortable.  It was not obvious from the description that the house backed onto the M5 motorway.  There is not a lot of natural light so in the evenings and in autumn and winter the lights need to be on.  The wifi is not able to stream music or video.
1331613,35335582,2015-06-17,1026568,Catherine,The accommodation is very clean and comfortable.   Off street parking for your car and very safe and secure.  The house is very spacious.   The beds are very comfortable with good quality linnen.  The location was excellent only 15 min from the airport and 10minutes from Black river Park where we needed to be for visas purposes.   Wendy is a very attentive host.  She responded very quickly to all emails and made sure we knew exactly how to get to the address.   We will recommend this accommodation and will make use of it again. Thank you Wendy for hosting us.
1331613,39384299,2015-07-23,9437133,Michael,We had a lovely stay and were well looked after by Wendy's son and his wife since they were on vacation. Nice big house in a nice neighbourhood  with full bathroom and toilet in each bedroom - and electrically-heated mattresses  a real bonus for winter. Only downside was the poor internet connection over the first few days  but this was quickly fixed.
1331613,52501409,2015-10-30,18371863,Anne,Ce que je retiendrai de ce sjour chez Wendy c'est avant tout son sourire sa gentillesse sa disponibilit et son sens de l'accueil qui fait de ce logement un endroit o l'on se sent bien. Merci pour son hospitalit et les petites attentions trs personnelles qui ont fait de ce sjour un moment particulier.
1331613,53841103,2015-11-13,47010296,,Wendy is a very good owner. The house is beautiful and clean. We can use the Wifi in the house. When I left I lost my hat in her house  she found it and keeped it  for me. Now I already get it.Thanks
1331613,59500701,2016-01-11,3029825,Joffra,Great place  lots of space and lovely hosts.
1331613,64659725,2016-03-06,53222128,Lynda,Comfortable and cosy cottage in a beautiful neighborhood. The cottage had all the amenities you could have needed including air-conditioning for the hot summer days. Wendy and Walter were attentive and friendly. All you could ask for in a home away from home
1331613,67824101,2016-03-31,49004412,Joanne,Superb setting  thoroughly enjoyed our stay  thank you
1331613,69422382,2016-04-11,15147818,Liesel,We had a lovely stay in Cape Town in Wendy's home. It was a very comfortable and well located base for us and great for the kids. We didn't spend too much time there though as we were out and about as well as visiting family nearby. In terms of location  comfort and security  it was a great spot. Thank you Wendy
1331613,101899965,2016-09-15,32317519,Clancy,We absolutely loved our stay at Wendy and Walter's home. It was almost as if it was our second home. Location provided the perfect balance between work commitments and play. The space was more than ample and having the home serviced during the day was a huge plus. We loved the outdoor BBQ  especially the time shared with our hosts chatting about life in South Africa. We hope to return soon
1331613,114421495,2016-11-18,8592772,Pat,Fabulous hosts. Couldn't be more helpful. If you are looking to relax and sunbathe around the pool it prob is a bit cramped if you are a large group and it's very shady. Uber is a great option to use if not booking a car as public transport is not really an option. If you want to be away from the hustle and bustle it's a fab location.
1331613,128235350,2017-01-23,52073092,,
1331613,130191405,2017-02-05,17328083,Ya Qin,Its a lovely wooden and romantic house in the most clean and comfortable district of cape town.The hosts are very nice.
1331613,133685655,2017-02-24,25652791,Anne,Merci Wendy et Walter pour l'accueil  La maison est trs propre et confortable  avec une salle de bain dans chaque chambre. Wendy nous a donn beaucoup de conseils pour les visites  c'est super 
1331613,136691982,2017-03-12,21216418,John,Very homely and comfortable. Has character  especially in the attic room. The beds are very comfortable and the kitchen well equipped  though we never had time to use it It's very suburban in that area so about 10-15 mins walk to nearest area of shops  but taxis are so easy to get it's almost not worth mentioning. Hosting friendly and unobtrusive  exactly as you would want
732339,701960663056994567,2022-08-26,231941719,Wickus,Beautiful setting in a safe and secluded area  easy access to amenities  highways and shops all around the area. Clean  modern and cosy room  will definitely visit again.
732339,780975019668403226,2022-12-13,255627676,Deepesh,Great efficient service from Otto. Also sufficient lighting during load shedding
732339,799815056363618582,2023-01-08,185693268,Simon,Otto was extremely friendly and welcoming on arrival. The place was as advertised. We had to do lots of laundry and this was not an issue. I especially liked that the clothes line was in an enclosed area. This avoided us having to worry about strong winds and rain. Belleville is a suburb but if you have a car  its within an hour mostly 30-40minutes of so many attractions. I would definitely stay again.
1331613,149053123,2017-05-02,125514551,Lizzie,The house is actually more nice than it looks on pictures
1331613,180012293,2017-08-09,133764466,Colleen,This establishment was perfectly located for our needs. Wendy went out of her way to accommodate us and we felt really at home. Small things made a big difference  like 2 prong adapters next to the bed for charging mobile phones  fresh milk in the fridge and a bowl of fresh fruit. Thank you Wendy.
1331613,210561643,2017-11-10,157878055,Joanne,Great stay in suburb of Cape Town.
1331613,212756495,2017-11-19,3402417,Allan,We enjoyed our staye at Wendys. She was very welcoming and helpful. The accommodation has everything you need to ensure a comfortable stay. Great location too  with quick access to everywhere
1331613,215702146,2017-12-01,69849099,Monica,Wendy is a wonderful host  very knowledgable about the city highlights  concerned about little details and she made us feel at home a very cozy home. Everything was just perfect and she even manage to arrange some wonderful flowers for a special occasion my 80th mom's birthday. We've rented a car and it was very easy to go out and in Wendy's house. It made our staying at Cape Town very special. Thank you Wendy
1331613,218137629,2017-12-11,26460751,Susanne,Wendys house is great for a few days in Cape Town. It takes about 10min into town by car and its not far from the airport either. The rooms are well spaced and we had all we needed. Wendy and her husband were considered and attentive hosts.
1331613,219607522,2017-12-18,15435488,Travis And Xavier,Convenient location. Nice and spacious accommodation.
1331613,220610353,2017-12-23,11598756,Jen,Lovely hosts - very kind and informative with local tips. Great location for seeing the many Cape highlights
1331613,223891643,2018-01-02,113563039,Roxanne,What a gem of a place We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Wendys place. The photos and descriptions are very accurate. I even found the place better than depicted. There were 5 of us in total and we had more than enough space. I definitely recommend this spot Im from Canada  Wendy was fantastic with her quick responses and answered all our questions within a blink Cant wait to visit Cape Town and Wendy again.

1331613,238597209,2018-02-26,131240837,Ben,A fantastic place to stay--easily a 1510 The rooms are well-aquipped with anything you could possibly need while on vacation. It's a beautiful  clean place with great common spaces and individual rooms. There's even a swimming pool. More significantly  Wendy is the sweetest host  who takes pride in making sure that her guests have a terrific time staying in her home and exploring Cape Town. She gave great recommendations of places to eat and recreate and even  at times  provided short rides Expect a terrific time if you stay with Wendy
1331613,244176879,2018-03-18,176161247,Maximilian,Loved the place. Better than the pictures. Clean  spacious  stylish  each room has an ensuite bathroom and safe and secure parking. What a pleasure.
1331613,245906155,2018-03-24,15397176,Jacqueline,We stayed at Wendys place for a week while we toured Cape Town and visited our daughter who is a student at UCT. Wendys home was the perfect place for us as it is nicely decorated  clean  in a great  central location for tourists and is situated in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Wendy and her husband are excellent hosts they are welcoming and helpful and very easy to reach with questions  yet they allowed us space to wander in and out as we toured the beautiful city sights and beaches nearby.  Off street parking was also great because we rented a car for the week. I would like to add that  although the home has WiFi  it is somewhat weak and unreliable. This was not an issue for us and did not in any way deter from our amazing stay  but anyone who may be dependent on a strong signal may want to know.
732339,849860179136685313,2023-03-18,263653580,El,Wonderful friendly host Very Lekker place to stay at. Everything you need  nice and central  great for work trips
1331613,249607622,2018-04-02,97351400,Lynette,We had a lovely stay. The house was perfect for us and its location with regards to the Two Oceans venue could not have been better. The house was very clean  with a very cosy  relaxing ambience. Thank you so much for the friendly reception
1331613,251571593,2018-04-08,63848588,Carey,Great place if you are out and  about all day as this place is very central.
1331613,319818781,2018-09-07,33406141,Murray,The pictures  description and budget category are accurate and we got what we expected  plus Wendy and family's hospitality and friendly care. This was a work stay and I would love to go back and stay there for a family holiday. The house offers an excellent base for explorations of the Western Cape  and Wenda as a seasoned hostess has great advice in this regard.
1331613,326998043,2018-09-23,95227597,Steven,Wendy is a superb host and the overall experience was enjoyed by all 3 couples staying there. Great braai bbq facilities

1331613,342628148,2018-10-29,64889945,Beverly,Wendy  and husband Wally  were great hosts.  They grocery shopped for us per our short list prior to our arrival  and went out of their way to take us to the airport on our return.  Wendy was helpful in recommending restaurants and in advancea private tour guide for 2 tours.  They chatted if it seemed we wanted to  but left us to ourselves when we wanted privacy.  the house was clean and cheerful.  beds VERY comfortable on the firm side.  Bed linens crisp  bath towels thick and soft Kitchen had whatever we needed. Patio was so calming...we were there in late October  so pool not warm yet  but didn't matter  as it added to the ambiance.   Only thing to consider is that whoever has upstairs beds will have a steep set of stairs to climb...we were ok  but  might affect someone else.  If we return to Cape Town  we would definitely stay here again.
1331613,347330901,2018-11-11,215745272,Michele,The house was exactly as described and was very spacious  clean and  very comfortable.   Three nice sized bedrooms and four updated bathrooms. Fully appointed kitchen with everything you need to do some home cooking. Although there was only the two of us my husband and I we found the space to be exactly what we needed....to be able to relax and unwind after a long days of sightseeing. Wendy was the perfect host.  The day we arrived we needed to grab a few groceries and Wendy offered to drive us to the local Woolworth's about 2 kms away.  Not only did Wendy drive us but she waited while we picked up our groceries That is definitely going the extra mile. Both Wendy and her husband made us feel right at home.  We would definitely recommend Wendy's place for comfort  a lovely quiet neighbourhood and for such gracious hospitality.
1331613,348498837,2018-11-14,19533317,Daniel,Wendy and her husband were very kind and the house was great to stay in. Every room has its own bathroom  wich is realy nice. Every evening we had a nice chat and braai in the garden and it was nice to have them arround.

We were very comfortable  enjoyed the patio area and were able to spread out through the many rooms. It was centrally located  15 minutes to the waterfront and not far from Table Mountain and beautiful vineyards. We rented a car which was useful. A mall was nearby with a grocery store and a couple restaurants. We highly recommend it and would definitely stay again.
1331613,402644335,2019-01-19,160754054,Kerri,Nicky was a fabulous host  very welcoming and with good tips. The house was very comfortable and had everything we needed. The location is great for exploring different areas of the city. I'd highly recommend staying with Wendy.

732409,9585045,2014-01-03,3038840,Rainer,Es war groartig  besonders weil wir uns auf Deutsch unterhalten konnten. Die Unterkunft lag etwa 35 Autominuten von Waterfront entfernt. Das hatte Vorteile  denn wir erlebten mal andere Stadt- und Umgebungsteile. Wir entdeckten Ratanga Junction und Century City. Unser Sohn konnte auf der groen Wiese vor dem Haus drauen Fuball spielen und hatte Mglichkeiten zum Toben am Teich und auf dem Spielplatz  Wir fhlten uns sicher. Otto war ein wunderbarer Gastgeber  sogar an die Kaffeefiltertten hatten er und seine Frau gedacht. Alles war sehr sauber  praktisch und gemtlich. Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit. Und wir konnten in Richtung Weingter unsere Ausflge starten.

732409,52770404,2015-11-01,12073502,Jerry,Otto's flat was a great base from which to travel to both Cape Town and the Winelands area. The flat is small  clean and contains everything you need for a short stay. Despite being attached to the main house  it is very private. We particularly enjoyed the private patio area and driveway.

Central and close to lovely shopping centers  and close to the Durbanville wine route. The little park is so calm  and Otto's neighborhood is great for people who like running - I went for runs in the morning and evening and always felt safe.

736534,1141223665067196580,2024-04-23,106474149,Shari,Florian and his staff were wonderful hosts as always

742345,513362690,2019-08-19,280578259,Lhun,Great apartment in a fantastic location Very close walking distance from great restaurants where you can have a drink or five  Woolies Food  bakeries  attractions  etc. Very reasonably priced for such an expensive location. Apartment was clean with fresh linen and towels. Bed is very comfy. The host has supplied everything you need in terms of appliances  utensils and cutlery. There is even DSTV available with all the channels AND Wifi. Great place to stay if you're looking to experience all the vibrance that the city has to offer. We also felt very safe we're from Joburg  so that's almost never the case. Would definitely recommend.
742345,556286670,2019-10-29,62256482,Rene,Great location to explore from  and even when the weather doesn't play along  the windows are big enough and the view good enough so you can open them  lie on the bed or couch and pretend you are outside.
742345,615493423,2020-03-08,178228202,Jaco,It was nice staying here. But photos misleading
742345,424334645820797174,2021-08-08,42407630,Bimba,not what is advertised
742345,523808864443261942,2021-12-23,348353224,Marko,Pictures are deceiving...will not recommend...
742345,549810266473841056,2022-01-28,3292641,Franziska,Stayed here for 2 weeks and at the end it felt like leaving home. Really enjoyed the apartment and the area. There are a few restaurants  really good cafes and the va nearby. The open window with seaview is so stunning but it can get a little noicy around there.
742345,617165847493649169,2022-05-01,192092667,Lin,It was so nice and central for us Check-in was super easy
742345,625841753066445398,2022-05-13,430660676,Catherine,It is central with views however the pictures are misleading.
742345,696941064198043725,2022-08-19,287345174,Komeshan,Very good location  value for money  beautiful view.
742345,736732896642699511,2022-10-13,221690909,Dirk,This was a beautiful apartment in a beautiful area of Cape Town. Definitely worth every cent  plus Koos  the team were all very helpful  friendly  welcoming and had top-notch communication
742345,779567766832413785,2022-12-11,299970629,Abdelmalek,It was a good flat studio  very good for single or pairs who whants to be close to sea point and waterfront
742345,832459087548331924,2023-02-22,58704971,Camilla,Great location with secure parking included. The flat was very clean with a lovely view There was some unexpected noise from the hotel next door where there often were braaiis and pool parties in the evenings. One could also hear the traffic from the main road. If a bit of noise won't bother you this is a good value spot.
742345,835319396355358506,2023-02-26,148907057,Jake,Great location  within walking distance to green point stadium and the waterfront. However  host wasn't that responsive and the self check-in was not easy at night with the gate being locked with some wire that I had to untangle. The blinds are terrible in the apartment and street lights shine in during the night. Overall good value for money though and can't complain at this price.
742345,836108332584404139,2023-02-27,489201230,Lorenzo,Excellent stay
742345,843346454088367713,2023-03-09,22943727,Vesna,Unterkunft war vllig ausreichend fr eine Nacht zu zweit. Sieht auf den Bildern jedoch viel schner aus  wie berll bei aurbnb. Ausstattung Kche war auch soweit in Ordnung. Sicherheit war gewhrleistet mi verschliessbarem Tor von aussen  Lage war sehr gut. Adresse stimmt nicht mit Maps berein. Uberfahrer konnte und nicht an den richtigen Ort bringen.
742345,1044097876550369474,2023-12-11,447534249,Victor,Good place
742345,1046930899898644299,2023-12-15,408144311,Evidence Lenah,was great  really dont have have anything negative to say about the place itself  there was a bit of construction going on around which was loud in the morning but otherwise its a great place. Looks exactly like in the pictures  Beautiful view honestly. Thank you Koos
742345,1047650730345706561,2023-12-16,166706628,Luchelle,Koos'  studio had all the basic amenities for our 1-night stay. Great value for money  well located- would recommend

742345,1105728273048093874,2024-03-05,444197456,Mohammad Rami,Great stay
742345,1107162743605261133,2024-03-07,256808620,Deirdre,Thank you Koos and team.  Thank you for being so flexible. We loved our short stay. Would recommend this apartment.
742345,1117222125954289754,2024-03-21,103459523,Kassim,definitely  worth a stay  a very comfortable accommodation with easy access to everywhere
742345,1162194995517323035,2024-05-22,108451818,Konrad,Stayed for a week. Good value and comfortable stay if you don't mind small annoyances  imperfections. Note the complex has two entrances when searching for the key box.
742345,1163598937896658149,2024-05-24,190292455,Burger,Nice location but do not expect a neat or upper-end stay. Flat block is old and a bit run down  a bit of maintenance needed inside the flat as well. Fortunately not an expensive booking  but perhaps a bit less neat than what we expected from the photo's. Overall good communication and seemless experience from check-in and check-out which is a plus.
742345,1165143962227555079,2024-05-26,578493781,Bulelani,The placeis a perfect location. You can walk if you don't feel like driving. To those that don't need the chaos of many people the place just tock all the boxes.
742345,1170150237616597353,2024-06-02,134248143,Jayson,Thanks for a great stay. Practical and great location.
1333749,10492994,2014-02-22,678390,Christian,We stayed 5 nights at Barbaras apartment in Camps Bay and it was the perfect place to explore Cape Town and the whole Cape area. The apartment is nice and cosy with an awsome view over Camps Bay and the ocean. The Table Mountain Cable Car station is about 5 minutes away by car as well as Signal Hill. The city center and VA Waterfront are like 10 minutes away by car and there is even a public bus running between Camps Bay and the city. It's easy to explore the city and all the things you want to see in Cape Town and Barbara is more then happy to tell you some nice places to go out for dinner or what ever you want to know. We will definitely stay there again whenever we will be back in Cape Town.
1333749,10833854,2014-03-10,4507274,Andrea,Barbara is a great host  easy to communicate with and always really helpful and reliable We really loved the appartement  its the perfect stay in Camps Bay Specially the outdoor area is beautiful  stunning looks over the ocean  a nice pool  safe area  it was perfect The appartement itself offers everything you need  a fully equipped kitchen  enough storage  a comfortable bed... it was really nice and clean We will def. come back
1333749,10903481,2014-03-12,3788537,David,we stayed here for two 2-day stays during our week in Cape Town  so you can find my other review below.  Barbara is a wonderful host with a nice spread with a fantastic view.  that picture she has to advertise the place is 100 accurate.  that's your view.  enjoy
1333749,10979513,2014-03-16,3788537,David,A wonderful host who took the time to meet us and introduce us to Camps Bay.  The apt is clean and relatively large for 2 persons with plenty of room to stretch out and relax after a long day of trekking around.  Don't miss the AM sunrise  worth setting the alarm or the PM sundowner from her exclusive back deck with fantastic views of the ocean and privacy.  All with private parking as well.  The location is perfectly central to camps bay with easy access down to the beach for drinks or a run  equidistant to the pipe track trail at the base of the 12 apostles  and an easy car ride past table mountain to Capetown central.  All in all  an excellent spread
1333749,11403819,2014-04-01,570006,Nahne,We stayed in the apartment on our first night in South Africa and liked it a lot The apartment and especially the location in Camps Bay is beautiful. Barbara is a friendly person  coordinating the arrival was easy and she made sure that we enjoyed our stay.
1333749,12148667,2014-04-24,12140278,Karen,Excellent location and well appointed.  Beautiful deck overlooking Camps Bay.  The apartment is small as any studio would be so just be prepared for that.
1333749,12398802,2014-05-01,12979436,Jocelyn,Lovely apartment with amazing sea view. Great location in the heart of Camps Bay  close to shops and beach. It is a studio apartment rather than a one bedroom  and I suspect it is an older block which has been refurbished. There is a washing machine for laundry but you should bring your own dishwashing and laundry soap  toiletries  and dishcloth. This would be a great place for a summer stay  as there is a large deck  pool and barbeque facilities. Barbara is very helpful and although the apartment is without wi-fi she offered to lend us mobile wi-fi.
1333749,22838791,2014-11-16,15142842,Bastian,A very good stay. Barbara was a very good host. Even her mother took care of us. Both are very nice people and we can recommend this apartment 100. Its located at camps bay  the perfect place to sleep  start the activities or just relax and enjoy the atmosphere. Always again
1469709,15109036,2014-07-02,16543107,Sarah,Jenny was fantastic She responded quickly to all communications and was extremely helpful in making my trip to Cape Town easy and very fun. The apartment was just as I expected if not better and had a magical view of Table Mountain from the cute balcony. The location was perfect there is a shopping square a block away with excellent coffee  a Spar grocery store and many interesting and eclectic bars and delicious cafesrestaurants. It also felt very safe and easy to get around. I was attending a conference at the Convention Center CC and I found it very easy to walk 10 min to the CC  which is located in an area with very little culturelife around it  unlike Jenny's place.
1469709,38735377,2015-07-18,14025721,Kristen,Great apartment to be your jumping off point in the city. Jenny made the process of getting the keys seamless and made sure our experience was great. This apartment has everything you need from washerdryer to table mountain views and great restaurants in the area. Would definitely recommend it to anyone getting newly acquainted with the city or here on holiday. Thanks Jenny
1469709,72981177,2016-05-06,22299799,Caitlin,The apartment is lovely and well located having it in a hotel setting was really convenient as we did not know the area well. Jenny was extremely responsive and we felt well taken care of.
1469709,86273078,2016-07-15,2743787,Chris,We had a wonderful stay in Capetown.  The apartment is in a good location - walking distance to many things and right across the street from a grocery store.  The apartment was very comfortable and the check inout process went very smoothly.
1469709,149421951,2017-05-04,116141589,Mike,Great location. Table Mountain view  close to grocery store  restaurants and access to Cape Town attractions. Well equipped apartment. Be prepared to spend extra for internet access.
1469709,204019008,2017-10-16,13299218,Hendrik,Das Appartement ist sehr gut gelegen und mit allem ausgestattet was man bentigt. Der Check-in und Check-out war sehr angenehm und unkompliziert. Fr einen Stdtetrip nach Kapstadt kann ich die Wohnung nur empfehlen
1469709,286355363,2018-07-06,48070420,Susan,Great location  easy to walk to the Waterfront  Bo-Kaap  the outdoor market and very close to a grocery store for quick meals or getting food to cook.
1469709,296261590,2018-07-25,3270107,Kendall,Good location.
1469709,421799397,2019-03-10,214212161,Thierry,excellente localisation pour dcouvrir  Cape Town   toutes les commodits  pied  le Waterfront  10 minutes  pied et au coeur de De Waterkant .  Appartement fonctionnel  salle de bains petite  manque un peu de chaleur  mais la localisation permet d'accepter ce petit dfaut Je recommande cet appartement mme si par rapport  d'autres expriences sur Cape Town avec AirBnb je trouve le rapport qualitprix un peu lev.
1469709,429845638,2019-03-29,77894725,Louise,We had a most enjoyable stay at Jennys place. It was lovely  stylish and modern. With all the necessary facilities. Having the balcony was ideal to sit out and have breakfast or unwind with a glass of wine in the evening. Ideally located  with a excellently stocked shop around the corner and bars and restaurants on the ground floor. we felt very safe here.
1469709,443066729,2019-04-25,91178773,Christo,Nice location. Safe and in a nice part of town.

1469709,745345635,2021-04-04,113085187,Nomnini,Value for money in central location.
1469709,401215291665271541,2021-07-07,36955003,La Wanda,This place is in a great location and has many amenities in waking distance. I stayed here for several months. I never had an issues with the neighbors. The only draw back is a foul odor that wafts out of the bathroom from time to time. If this is still an issue keeping the door closed helps.
1469709,477294645608694565,2021-10-20,303044051,Corme,Great stay and great location. Jenny is an excellent host.
1333749,23090904,2014-11-23,13741717,Eva,Tolles Appartment mit Meerblick Der Blick von der Terrasse ist ein Traum. Die Lage ist perfekt - Tafelberg  Strand und Stadt sind direkt um die Ecke. Barbara ist sehr hilfsbereit. Sie hat uns mit dem WLAN geholfen und Tipps gegeben  was Sightseeing usw. betrifft. Ich wrde jederzeit wieder kommen.
1333749,23788011,2014-12-10,22332929,Vanessa,Wenn wir es vorher besser gewusst htten  wren wir direkt lnger geblieben   Wir empfehlen das Appartment ungern weiter  weil wir es eigentlich fr uns ganz alleine haben wollen  Das Appartment ist wundervoll und wir fhlten uns durch Barbaras Untersttzung zu jeder Zeit pudelwohl
1333749,24031770,2014-12-17,23797522,Trutz,Everything was perfect. Very nice host  stunning views. Perfect place for a couple. Thanks for the good time Barbara
1333749,24362500,2014-12-27,18841925,Michael,Barbara made my girlfriend and I feel incredibly welcome at the apartment. She has such a warm demeanor  we felt right at home as soon as we arrived. We couldn't have asked for a better host
1333749,25430764,2015-01-16,7227847,Brian,We had a great experinec staying with Barbara. We had just finished four weeks of travel and spending the last four days in Barbaras apartment was a perfect ending.
1333749,26135338,2015-02-04,1835577,Lasse Og Trine,Barbara's apartment is just great Highly recommendable and perfect location. It also has a nice swimming pool and a terrace with magnificent ocean view.
1333749,26667152,2015-02-16,11777431,Colin,Even though this was an incredibly last minute booking  Barbara was super helpful and accommodating. The place is in a prime location with amazing views of the ocean and Lion's Head  and close to heaps of bars  cafes and restaurants. The apartment had everything my girlfriend and I needed and we would have loved to have stayed longer Barbara was not just a great host but a lovely person and it was really nice meeting and talking with her. Highly recommended
1333749,26816599,2015-02-20,10046089,Bianca And Ludwig,Barbara hat immer schnell geantwortet  vor der Anreise als auch whrend des Aufenthaltes.

1333749,27710276,2015-03-10,20042947,Marc,Barbara was absolutely fantastic and the apartment was a perfect place for us to base ourselves. The deck in front was a perfect place to chill with a bottle of vino as the sun faded each night over the Antlantic Thanks again Barbara  appreciate everything Marc and Del
1333749,27816593,2015-03-12,27646152,Nils,Perfect place for relaxing. The  apartment is located in a very quiet area and has an awesome view on the bay. Barbara was friendly and helped us wherever she could.
1333749,28866235,2015-03-31,22715959,Georgina,Barbara's apartment was fabulous. Such a lovely home away from home and the perfect base to explore all that Cape Town has to offer. Barbara was a fantastic host and couldn't be more helpful  giving us tips on local restaurants and attractions. We would love to stay again if we return to Cape Town.
1333749,29452846,2015-04-07,6362908,Matthew,The apartment was just what we were looking for during our quick stay in Cape Town. Its perfectly situated in Camps bay and has a lovely sea view. Barbara was a great host and very accommodating.
1333749,30129097,2015-04-18,4836716,Lucy,Incredible views in a perfect location My boyfriend and I stayed for 8 nights and we recommend it highly to couples for a short stay in Cape Town. Barbara was really lovely and very easy to get hold of when we needed.
1333749,30456217,2015-04-22,15222094,Vanessa,Barbara organized our arrival even if not in town this day  which was fine. Nice neighbourhood and beautiful view from the appartment  as shown on the photos  The studio is very correctly furnished  to cook simple food and spend a nice stay. As improvments as I would suggest free Wifi not active during our stay. Also to be noted  the apartment was very bright  maybe a bit too much in the morning no curtains everywhere   but perfect the rest of the day 
1333749,31691846,2015-05-09,11010094,Nathalie,Alles perfekt - die Lage ist ein Traum  die Aussicht auf den Atlantik ist atemberaubend. Einschlafen und Aufwachen mit Meeresrauschen hat uns sehr entspannt. Die bergabe der Wohnung hat sowohl bei Ankunft  als auch bei Abreise super geklappt. Barbara war total flexibel in den Zeiten und wir durften am Abreisetag bis nachmittags in der Wohnung bleiben. Wir wrden jederzeit wieder hier buchen
1333749,32653595,2015-05-19,766230,Benn,We loved staying so close to Camps Bay during our second week in the Cape. Barbara was a very accommodating host  and very easy to communicate with. This apartment has the feel of staying at a summer beach camp - very basic  but with beautiful views and a very easy walk or drive to the beachfront.
1333749,35239683,2015-06-16,17086204,Brian,A great hostess  very clean with a great view of the ocean Highly recommended place to stay.  It did not disappoint
1333749,48285831,2015-09-25,40362538,Bridget,Barbara was lovely. Even though she was on holiday overseas she was very responsive and made sure we were completely taken care of. The property is cozy  but has everything you need and is in a safe neighbourhood with a great view. Close to a nice beachy community with good restaurants and accessible to the rest of Cape Town. Would've liked a little more personal attention in terms of recommendations and guidance as it was our first time in the city  but understandable as the host wasn't on site.
1333749,51998575,2015-10-25,4978538,Caroline,Very nice flat with incredible view on camps bay. Just bring your earplugs As it can be a bit noisy. Thanks Barbara 
1495471,58815654,2016-01-05,46802378,Sijo,Very pleasant stay at Joe's BB. Perfect location for a few days Cape Town  nice and comfortable room  friendly staff.
1333749,52403403,2015-10-29,42664645,Nicholas,Lovely  friendly and very welcoming host. Quiet  great location for camps bay and surrounding area.
1333749,53243082,2015-11-07,25927436,Ben,Nice Apartment at very good location.  Lovely terrace with awsome view over the ocean. Bath is very small. This was the only non serviced unit during our stay in South Africa. Contact to Barbara was ok but dependable on internet which you have to pay for in advance in an phone shop for the wifi in the apartement.
1333749,53805564,2015-11-13,35086603,Sabrina,Meine erste Airbnb-Buchung und gleich ein voller Erfolg Schon im Vorfeld hat Barbara schnell und freundlich auf alle Fragen geantwortet und das Apartment hat gehalten  was uns versprochen wurde. Nette und sichere Wohngegend  ein atemberaubender Blick  der uns jeden Tag aufs Neue verzckt hat und ein Apartment das mit allem ausgestattet ist  was man so braucht. Konnten super abschalten und uns entspannen. Barbara hat uns super nett empfangen und auch bei der Schlsselbergabe am Ende war sie total flexibel. Vielen Dank fr einen tollen Urlaub
1333749,55414221,2015-12-01,47278448,Martin,Sehr freundliche und unkomplizierte Gastgeber. Das Appartment ist schn und hat eine super Aussicht. Wir kommen gerne wieder einmal wenn wir das nchste Mal in Sdafrika sind.
1333749,55776503,2015-12-06,37708512,Ashley,Lovely apartment and what a fantastic view The apartment was clean  tidy and perfectly sized for two people. There is a large outdoor space looking out over Camps Bay and a shared pool just around the corner. Arranging the stay was easy with Barbara and she was very welcoming and friendly.  One thing to note the apartment complex is a little way 15min walk up the hill from the main road on sea front but in a lovely quiet location. We generally walked down the hill in the evening and then took a very cheap taxi back up again All in all I'd definitely recommend a stay here 
1333749,58800455,2016-01-05,7544186,Joe,Wonderful place  great location and great host. She met us at the unit  gave us a quick tour and some recommendations on where to eat. We were only there one night  but didn't have any trouble with finding her recos or getting around the apartment.
1333749,59192745,2016-01-08,22855182,David,Die Wohnung ist wunderbar gelegen und bietet Meerblick ber Camps Bay. Barbara ist beraus nett und zuvorkommend. Das Appartment ist gerumig und es mangelt an fast nichts. Vielen Dank
1333749,59562471,2016-01-12,42482981,Janelle,The arrival was prompt and courteous and we received excellent restaurant recommendations around town.  The view was amazing and very comfortable with everything we needed to rest and stay refreshed to enjoy the beautiful areas.  The flat had great access to the pool and a quick drive to beautiful beaches and dining.  I would absolutely recommend this place and wish we had more time to stay.
1333749,60005016,2016-01-18,48978722,Tara,Barbara was so helpful when we arrived and always available if we needed anything later on. The house was beautiful - wish we could have stayed longer.
1333749,65142811,2016-03-11,3215333,Helen,Barbara was very responsive and couldn't fault her or the accommodation.  A lovely spot to relax and experience camps Bay
1333749,66381958,2016-03-22,53235478,Amanda,Apartment is as per photos and in a good neighborhood. Barbara was very welcoming.
1333749,69158242,2016-04-09,32223579,Leen,We loved staying at Barbara's flat. It has an amazing view of Camps Bay  its very comfortable and clean. Barbara was also very charming and helpful and we will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Cape Town if her flat is available ...which is not very often...A real recommender for singles or couples
1333749,75438100,2016-05-21,12543371,Vanessa,Barbara and her apartment were amazing The apartment itself was bright and very clean. The view of Camps Bay was wonderful The apartment is just a short  easy drive down to the beach. Barbara was extremely accommodating  kind  and quick to help with suggestions for local restaurants which all proved to be hidden gems. We ran into a few issues and while she was quick to help  it should be known that other travelers will run into this also. Wifi is not included in this apartment. There is a wifi 'hookup' but you will be running into town to pay for wifi. Barbara was kind enough to set us up with wifi for the first day  but had we known that there was no wifi we would have been much more prepared. Also  the front drive through gate broke while we were there so we were stuck outside in the middle of the night for quite some time. We had called Barbara to ask for help  but unfortunately she was unable to come help us. The gate breaking was totally not Barbara's fault  but making sure you have the key to the side walk through gate would ensure that you are not stuck outside if it happens again. All in all we would absolutely recommend Barbara's apartment.
1333749,106595658,2016-10-07,947328,Alain,Nous avons reu toutes les informations concernant un  sjour  agrable.
1333749,109538564,2016-10-22,13560179,Alix,Great place - wonderful view
1333749,116497708,2016-12-01,83026765,James,Barbara's apartment has the most incredible views over Camps Bay from the private terrace. well located for an easy walk to the beach  bars and restaurants of Camps Bay.
1333749,122814700,2016-12-26,10461023,Alan,Barbara's place was fantastic What a view and in a great area that feels' secluded  but is really close to the beach and the city. Was a great stay over Christmas and makes us want to return to Camp's Bay and Cape Town soon
1333749,123408483,2016-12-29,62689242,Abi,Barbara was an excellent host and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her sea view apartment. The photos do not do the breathtaking ocean views and scenery enough justice The location is ideal as it is walking distance to the beach and restaurants in Camps Bay. You will definitely enjoy your stay here 
1333749,124921757,2017-01-03,19751640,Adriana,If you are looking for good location in Camps Bay with a terrace and a nice view this is the place to be  just 15 minute walk  from the beach.  We had an amazing time and  Barbara was really cool and helpful. Its ideal for one or  two persons  though it might get really hot inside the apartmente during the daytime  in the afternoon and during the night its ok.
1333749,125136343,2017-01-04,738741,Louise,Beautiful Views and very quiet neighbourhood
1333749,125521595,2017-01-06,23900995,Nina,The apartment is very nice and in a great location with beautiful views down to the sea. The apartment is nicely furnished  inside is cosy and outside has a large balcony and swimming pool. Barbara is a great host and went out of her way to ensure we had hot water when the boiler broke. Thanks for a lovely stay next time we'll come for longer   best wishes Nina and James
1333749,126894318,2017-01-15,85426325,Neil,A very cosy spot for a short break. Fanastic views and a very well laid out apartment.

1333749,129767985,2017-02-02,4274760,Matthew,Barbara's place is very beautiful and the views are quite a bit better than the pictures suggest  I had a great stay  as I had friends nearby but could escape here to relax as it is extremely quiet and peaceful.  All amenities are present and Barbara was super helpoful and friendly.  I would love to go back.
1333749,130222720,2017-02-05,4101090,Mike,Great little apartment  with fabulous views of Camps Bay. Highly recommended  and Barbara is so helpful and lovely. We will definitely revisit Good wifi for Uber etc. Great decking area for views of the Ocean while sipping a sundowner. Nice quiet  safe residential area. I'd thoroughly recommend staying here.
1333749,132486705,2017-02-18,24703093,Stuart,A terrific apartment in Camps Bay  within walking distance of the restaurants and shops on the seafront and the beach. Great to sit out on the patio watching the sunset over the Atlantic. Barbara was very helpful and we appreciate her accommodating us at the last minute.
1333749,133888517,2017-02-25,3091322,Raphael,Barbara ist ein grossartiger Host. Der Kontakt war easy und sie ist sehr hilfsbereit Gerne wieder wenn wir nach Kapstadt reisen. Die Wohnung liegt ideal. Nah beim Zentrum und trotzdem ruhig.
1333749,141405352,2017-04-02,23378596,Marc,This is a great studio flat in a really fantastic location above Camp's Bay. The views to the ocean below are spectacular and you can sleep with the sound of the waves crashing ashore below. The flat is also right next to the swimming pool and BBQ area and therefore has the best access of any flat in the block. We had poor internet but that was to do with Barbara's service provider and Barbara tried to get it improved. We shall almost certainly stay again in the future if this little jewel is still available.
1333749,141668334,2017-04-04,16337317,Lloyd,Everything was as described. Clean and comfortable. A little far to walk to the beach front restaurants but perfect location for peace and quiet and lovely views. It's great that Barbara had included wifi and her communication and helpfulness is excellent.
1495471,404209587,2019-01-23,52597099,Ryan,Joes s place is exceptional in every way great location  clean  and very well run.
1519294,24913508,2015-01-04,20382773,Kim,The apartment was everything we had hoped for. Modern  clean  incredible views and a location from heaven. We had a wonderful holiday and would most certainly stay there again in the future.
1333749,215686295,2017-12-01,67298097,Suzanne,Amazing location with superb views. Great base for exploring cape town  extremely close to table mountain  restaurants  beaches and bars of camps bay  1015 mins drive to the waterfront. The deck area is a great bonus
1519294,58770891,2016-01-05,17224817,Ian, A great compact apartment  great views. Easy to get around Cape Town with access to beach. A great place to use as a base to explore the city. Genevieve was a great manager and assisted us with move in details  cleaning services and was always a call away Thanks
1519294,62881611,2016-02-18,20609793,David,Our family had a great time here. Sitting on the deck sipping coffee in the morning was divine - great setting  lovely view The beach is a beautiful place to stroll. The apartment is well furnished and quite liveable. Wood floors and lots of woodwork and nice master bath. A leisurely and scenic fifteen minute walk gets you to a great coffee place in Bantry Bay. The other direction is the very lively waterfront scene of Camps Bay. And you're just a fifteen minute uber ride to the central district of Cape Town  or the Waterfront. We would stay there again for sure.
1519294,115232778,2016-11-22,48312048,Jon,We had a sublime 7weeks close to the beach. The apartment is compact but very cleverly designed. A wonderful place to stay and would highly recommend it Thanks Margot and Genevieve.
1519294,120238469,2016-12-09,38770813,Ian,This place is much smaller than it is made to look in the pictures and. I felt ripped off. There is no cleaning service as is the custom in SA. Interaction with the host and her representative was distasteful.
1519294,124622290,2017-01-02,44103960,Soula,It is truly a little spot of paradise and would love to come back
1519294,128488903,2017-01-25,108907042,James,Awesome place  best location  great people  look no further

1333749,225392456,2018-01-06,2564957,Anja,Loved the place and especially the huge deck that offers great views over Camps Bay. Very tranquil place to relax. Easy walk down to the beach but a little work-out to get back up the hill when returning. Barbara was always available when we needed her and quick to respond. Thank you for a few lovely summer days
1333749,227807149,2018-01-16,159317185,Jacinta,Great location- more of a 20 minute walk down to the beach  nice and easy downhill and no need for the gym with the walk back up - the outdoor area absolutely makes this apartment. Sun all day round and incredible views. The kitchen crockeryglasses are a bit mismatched FYI in case you wanted to open some nice wines on your stay...you can take them to restaurants for a tiny corkage fee instead. Good space for the money.
1333749,230845253,2018-01-29,101141694,Doris,Wonderful location above Camps Bay with awesome view from huge deck. Apartment is eqipped with everything needed to feel comfortable. You hardly find studios in this neighbourhood that come with such a spacious terrace.
1333749,233849128,2018-02-11,38525309,Richard,Very good location and views to the sea  super little studio that works well with great decking area  nice pool  quiet shared space
1333749,235542355,2018-02-17,165364950,Gianna,Barbara's place was a perfect little spot. It was cozy and felt homey. The back porch was amazing with beautiful views the area. Barbara herself was a great host  extremely nice and friendly  and offered great suggestions during our time there. Would definitely recommend this place
1333749,236389434,2018-02-19,36404994,Jessica,Wonderful studio apartment in an excellent location with secure parking. The terrace makes the place with quiet space for contemplation and splendid views. Barbara was so welcoming and accommodating. I would really recommend this airbnb. Thank you Barbara
1333749,237255342,2018-02-22,614436,Dennis J.,amazing view and great deck overlooking ocean
1333749,238107500,2018-02-25,17552022,Max,Beautiful apartment with an absolutely stunning view of Camps Bay's ocean front. Quick and easy access to all main attractions in and around Capetown and the beach front is in walking distance 15 minutes Would have loved to stay longer Also  Barbara is a superb host  flexible and always quick to reply. We will most definitely be back
1333749,242500349,2018-03-12,129460033,Emma,Fantastic views  beautiful garden space  lovely studio apartment with everything you need. We loved our week here
1333749,248782835,2018-04-01,69593176,Tersia,The apartment has lovely views and is easily reachable. Barbara was also a lovely host. For us the apartment was smaller than was expected  but still enjoyed our stay there.
1333749,348259139,2018-11-13,26348916,Matthew,Lovely host  cracking views and a nice walk down to the beach.
1333749,350427676,2018-11-19,2458221,Ibere,Very belated review but here it goes  amazing views  extremely well located in camps bay  a primarily residential  safe and quiet area. Close to the beach and cbd  ideal base for exploring the town. Plus Barbara is the sweetest host  gave lots of great tips and was very communicative via messaging app
1333749,355178508,2018-12-03,5489955,Scott,The view of Camps Bay and the Atlantic Ocean from this Airbnb is absolute perfection. Whether it was breakfast at the table or relaxing with a glass of wine watching the sunset you'll want to spend all of your time on the deck. The apartment and the complex has everything you need and within a 10 minute safe walk to the main road in Camps Bay. Barbara gave us some great local tips and was very responsive to all of our questions. Highly recommend
1333749,358125757,2018-12-13,16918494,Jackie,The view from this apartment is beautiful. The space is clean and has everything you need. The beach is nearby about a 15-minute walk  as are great restaurants and stores for necessities. We loved having breakfast on the large deck each morning and theres a shared pool to enjoy too but we seemed to be the only people using it. Barbara was great to plan with and made great recommendations about the area. She also allowed us to extend our stay and check out late to accommodate our late flight. Everything was great
1333749,360582449,2018-12-21,66040997,Corne,Perfectly situated
1333749,364113271,2018-12-30,63525089,Joe,Barbara is a very kind host  which provides you with many local informations. The place is perfect  great location  much space and beautiful view.
1333749,364713964,2018-12-31,9260353,Alberto,I JUST SPENT ONE NIGHT IN HER APARTMENT  CLEAN  COMFORTABLE AND A BEAUTIFUL VIEW
1333749,369062600,2019-01-09,43759392,Scott,Excellent place to stay in camps bay. Amazing views Barbara was extremely helpful and accommodating- meeting us at the property at a time that suited us.
1333749,401623198,2019-01-15,211911518,Tara,The location of the apartment is great and has a fantastic view. We were however disappointed with our stay. We have only stayed at a couple of Airbnb but all have been far better. In essence the apartment has so much potential. It is in need of modernisation  but despite this there are some small bits that are missing which make all the difference when traveling. They may seem small  but shows the level of thought provided by the owner. With limited space there was no where to put our cases  so design of the apartment could be better. No coat hooks  one old pillow each with 2 old spare ones in the cupboard with no pillow cases  broken garden furniture  old mouldy coffee  no tea bags  no soap powder for the washing machine  no plug socket that the hair dyer provided would work in  small uncomfortable bed  smart tv that had no access to normal channels  no written information for the apartment on how to use equipment or info on the area. Please done fill that I am moaning as the owner was lovely  but if you are expecting to use this as a base for more than a night  you will need to be prepared. The pictures make the apartment look far bigger and feel that it needs a good clean. Sorry to provide such a review  but when making a decision on booking you should be aware of all the facts. If you want a sea view  access to a shared pool  limited space and a lovely location for a couple of nights  then it maybe for you.
1333749,405021650,2019-01-26,83937443,Gill,This is a great apartment  exactly as described.  We just loved the terrace and views.  Barbara is a great host and nothing was too much trouble.
1333749,409947817,2019-02-09,38525309,Richard,Lovely homely flat with a great view
1333749,411991304,2019-02-14,28358166,Callum,Excellent spot for a few days chilling in Camps Bay. Barbara was very communicative and met us at check-in which was super easy. Her place has wonderful views over Camps Bay and is well positioned out of the wind which is great when the beach is getting blasted. Its a 20 minute walk downhill to the amenities and we tended to get an Uber back as they are plentiful and cheap. Would definitively go back.
1333749,423794329,2019-03-15,9569317,Danny,Lovely host  great location. Would recommend.
1333749,575448145,2019-12-10,168776105,Philipp,Tolle Unterkunft mit super Ausblick. Nette Gastgeberin
1333749,580160881,2019-12-22,8407952,Nicole,The view of this place is stunning. The apartment is quite old and a little run down. I personally missed a little touch for detail and comfort. There were no pool towels as well as no drying rack  although there is a washing machine. The WiFi was very slow. The host said that is due to the previous guests using up all the data.
1333749,584436381,2019-12-30,81719266,Niall,Barbaras place is perfect for visiting the Camps Bay area of Cape Town. Fantastic views over the ocean and super easy to walkuber to many superb restaurants nearby. As we like to experience a more local vibe away from tourist hotspots  Barbara gave us some great tips on place to visit  see and eat during our stay.
1333749,613561312,2020-03-02,2602360,Dominik,Great apartment  perfect location  safe  amazing view throughout the whole place  great deck  super friendly host. We loved staying at your place and anytime again Cheers

Barbara has just fitted a new kitchen too  so it was even better than the photos Barbara could not have been more friendly and helpful  she's an absolute star and we'd absolutely book with her again thank you Barbara

She came to meet us also at check out. We had such a lovely time and felt very safe. The deck was stunning. Comfy bed and good showerwhich are always my 2 biggest points. So great to get a load of washing done too Camps bay was the most vibrant place we visited with amazing restaurants
1333749,1030345041434129350,2023-11-22,158793801,Ian,A lovely little appartement in a secure and secluded spot overlooking the wonderful Camps Bay. Barbara was a great host  any problems she dealt with swiftly  she would arrive at the appartement on her little scooter with a big smile and a solution. I would definitely stay there again if I was staying in Camps Bay.

Exactly as described  even a little bit better when you are standing on the terrasse with its breathtaking sea view. can confirm what others said very calm despite camps bay peak season  privacy  pool most of the times for yourself alone. the only problem with this accomodation you just don't want to leave. Definitely recommend
1333749,1063691063012453461,2024-01-07,245455091,Jordan,Beautiful space located very close to the hustle and bustle of Camps Bay 5 minutes to the beach and the main strip of barsrestaurants yet you feel secluded on top of the hill. Great views  clean space  and Barbara was a very friendly host. Would love to stay longer next time.

1410077,24806990,2015-01-03,12989618,Deborah,Adi gave us a very generous welcome and couldn't have been more helpful. He has created such a marvellous place to enjoy the world  perfectly aligned to make the most of the view and most comfortable surroundings which you can't help but relax in to and enjoy. We loved our time there and left inspired and restored.
1519294,241670451,2018-03-10,152269679,Nicolene,What a beautiful place with the most spectacular view. I would like to add that the place wasnt 100 clean
1519294,251573814,2018-04-08,53140868,Belinda,This place must be the one with the most amazing view on earth  We loved every minute of our stay.  It is even more gorgeous than the pictures reflect.
1519294,263563748,2018-05-12,35913625,Bob,Beautiful  updated condo with stunning ocean views.  Easy  secure parking on rooftop. A vacation home only 15 minutes from downtown Cape Town. It was nice to explore the city and area  then come back to a comfortable place  going to sleep listening to the ocean waves.
1519294,330205861,2018-09-30,47418350,Hannah,This apartment in Clifton 1st Beach has the ultimate wow factor  The view is second to none and waking upfalling asleep to the sound of the ocean is very special Margot and Gary  the apartment manager  were both wonderful  always only a message away and very accommodating The flat amenities were great and parking onsite was a huge plus. My friends and I had a lovely stay and hope to be back one day
1519294,337416982,2018-10-16,50032031,Catherine,This place is magical.  The apartment has a wonderful homely look and feel  coupled with the spectacular beach and mountain views... it does wonders for the soul.  We didnt want to leave
1519294,351263312,2018-11-22,35161273,Max,Great condo in an even better location.  Communication and check-in were a breeze.  Wed definitely stay here again if given the opportunity.
1519294,361729036,2018-12-24,155324930,Tony,An amazing place to stay. Great views. Great location. Great environment.
1519294,366752618,2019-01-03,24323651,Mark,This apartment is in the best possible location in Cape Town  that is if you want to wake up to the sound of the ocean  watch the most perfect sunsets from your balcony everyday and have your own private steps down on to Clifton beach The unit is quite compact with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The curtains in the bedrooms aren't that dark so you do get quite a bit of morning light. The apartment felt very safe to me. The views from the balcony are indescribable - most perfect sunsets over-looking the ocean  views over the four Clifton beaches and Camps Bay  the mountains and you watch the clouds nestling over the mountains. I could sit on that balcony all day
1519294,435703179,2019-04-11,56326296,Jesper,Great location with outstanding views. Very cosy.
1519294,439460972,2019-04-19,188201973,Neil,Outstanding position with incredible accommodation - a prized spot

1519294,529715945,2019-09-15,66904250,Laura,This place has an incredible view over the sea and i will really miss the sound of the waves - so good The Appartement has everything you need and i can highly recommand this Place to everyone who loves to be close to the ocean We would come again... thanks Margot for this lovely place.
1519294,532685110,2019-09-20,95951075,Camille,The view was amazing  Better than the pictures  The place was very cozy and felt like home The location was no more than 10 minutes from most attractions The area was also pretty safe.  Margot and Liam were very easy to communicate with and attentive for any of our needs Thank you so much for hosting us 
1519294,536608358,2019-09-27,180845600,Amanda,Absolutely perfect. The views are stunning and you could not ask for a better location if you are looking to enjoy the beach  ocean waves  mountain views  and beautiful sunsets. I would definitely stay here again in the future Thanks for sharing your wonderful space  Margot
1519294,537828779,2019-09-29,296286743,Palesa,Beautiful space  beautiful view
1519294,550635295,2019-10-19,177867797,Gjm,Nice place to stay
1519294,554872967,2019-10-27,30179758,Jackie,If you are looking for a apartment right on the beach  here you find it. Just around 100 steps down the stairs.
1410077,587561371,2020-01-03,5527396,Niclas,Adis house is as wonderful as Adi himself I came a couple of days before my stay and had a coffee with him and it was a lovey way to get to know the neighborhood and the house. The house is perfectly designed and placed in a bay that tends to be a bit windy  but the design of the house keeps the wind away from the lovely patio and pool facing west over the Atlantic. The area feels super safe and a small farm village is within a 15 min walking distance. It might be a little pricey stay but you really get what you pay for. A stunningly designed house with all the luxury amenities you need. Five stars
1410077,530971256841586202,2022-01-02,70327920,Lance,Great accommodation  close to everything  beautiful views and much more.  I would recommend this  without hesitation.
1410077,575807303269870823,2022-03-05,16744901,Seluk,We had a great time with the house with the perfect view  thank you very much for everything.  see you again.
1410077,586016959235532379,2022-03-19,3170779,Matze,We fell in love with Adis house the moment we entered. Laid back and beautifully appointed with the most scenic views of the bay and beach. Perfect place to switch off.
1410077,759219651805318919,2022-11-13,359844925,Stephanie,This house is truly magical. I can't imagine a better view anywhere in the world. If you're looking for total privacy and tranquility then you won't find better than this. We watched whales playing in the ocean whilst laying in bed Adi is a fantastic host  he made sure we were totally comfortable throughout our stay. Alfred the housekeeper was on hand to answer any questions we had. Totally recommend this house and hope to come back again one day.
1410077,791112804921783749,2022-12-27,73794173,Henry,Best airbnb I've stayed in. A similar hotel suite would cost triple the price Adi could not have been more helpful. Aegir Brewery a short walk away makes it even better
1410077,796142791479471508,2023-01-03,5150496,Stephen,Adis villa and the view is simply breathtaking. House got great vibe and energy. Staring at the sea all day long. Would take the 40 min drive from CPT anytime for an empty  still natural beach and a villa that makes you feel like yourre just on top of the world. 10 of 10.
1410077,799865736253817896,2023-01-08,409126273,Tereza,This was the most stunning and most precious place we have ever been at and Adi  is such a perfect  helpful and caring host. I was in tears when leaving as this felt just too special. Thank you so much for letting us spend there the most beautiful and peaceful holidays of our life
1410077,802006097689156901,2023-01-11,1112311,Tobias,Magical place with breathtaking views. Adi is an amazing host with a cheerful attidude and always there if you need anything. We will come back at some point eventhough its a bit pricy. See you soon Adi. Thank you.
1410077,807029215571873385,2023-01-18,72096860,Barbara,Die Unterkunft hat alles was man sich wnscht  sie ist wunderschn  makelloses  besonders  atemberaubender Blick  hat Flair und carisma. Einfach unglaublicher wohlfhl Faktor. Wir kommen wieder  haben uns verliebt  danke Adi
1410077,812081247787207062,2023-01-25,99938681,Tom,I travel a lot and this was one of the nicest airbnbs I have stayed in.  The views are incredible and the house was perfect for us.  Adi is as good as it gets as a host.  We will definitely stay here again on our next trip.
1410077,816544771297657901,2023-01-31,189929470,Sabine,Tolles  stilvolles Haus mit spektakulrer Aussicht. Adi ist ein cooler Typ und war uerst hilfsbereit. Wir kommen gerne wieder
1410077,1053441983968590633,2023-12-24,3137470,Natalie,Breathtaking Simply breathtaking. Weve been to some amazing places around the world and this was up there. House is fantastic  Adi was wonderful  we will be back  thank you for letting us enjoy your home.
1410077,1067929116424413758,2024-01-13,4677216,Shane,Fabulous place in a great location.
1410077,1075179622000796317,2024-01-23,7405696,Sally,We had a wonderful stay at Adis unique and beautiful Noordhoek place. The location was ideal with spectacular views and a carefully considered layout to maximize comfort  quiet and beauty. Adi was wonderfulresponsive  flexible and proactive. We hope to return. Highly recommend.
1410077,1084706407518266971,2024-02-05,105950932,Thomas,Tolle Unterkunft mit Mega Aussicht 
1410077,1102003340540897677,2024-02-29,205790343,Ann,Adi was a very responsive and gracious host.  His home exactly matched the descriptions.  The view overlooking the water was gorgeous.  Very peaceful and quiet stay but also easy to visit the beach towns from here.  Very good stay.
1996591,9721927,2014-01-06,118388,Ami,We had a great stay at James' apartment at The Adderley. The apartment is beautiful modern  spacious  and with two balconies with fantastic views of Cape Town and Table Mountain in particular  right in the heart of the city walking distance to Long Street  St George's Mall  and nearby lots of great cafes and restaurants in a good neighborhood the building is right nearby The Taj. We were let in by the building manager rather than James and she even held our bags for us for a bit in her office so we could grab lunch since the guests before had left late. Also the building has a really nice pool in the central courtyard area and the neighbors are very friendly lots were having braais or bbqs out on their balconies and chatting with each other. Our only drawback was air conditioning - it got pretty hot in the apartment during the day and there was no air conditioning unit that we could see but there were a couple fans  This wasn't bad at all on the cloudy days  but on one particularly hot day we really felt it  But apart from that...we really loved our stay We'd love to come back.
1519294,567013787,2019-11-21,81218374,Donielle,Breathtaking. great location. Will stay here again.
1519294,570700255,2019-11-30,11950615,Andrew,This was everything we wanted in a stay and more. The location and view are the wow factor and we spent all of our mornings and evenings looking out and watching the waves or sunset. Having a view means having to walk down some steps to the beach but it's well worth it as it's quiet and relatively secluded. The apartment itself was stylish and cosy with everything you could possibly want. We loved spending time there as well as using it as a base to explore. Thank you so much Margot. We will certainly be back.
1519294,579233374,2019-12-20,45510127,Tsvetelina,Amazing location and a great place to stay. We couldnt pick a better place for 5 of us- 2 couples with a child to stay.
1519294,443925078352135846,2021-09-04,371627378,Gao Xia,This is a splendid property with amazing views of the Atlantic Ocean and Clifton 1st beach  it had everything you need and it was well stocked already with many essentials like oil salt  pepper  washing powder  dishwasher detergent etc. It truly felt like a home away from home  the kitchen is not very big but the impressive use of the space provided made it feel much better than it is. The property manager was amazing as well  she was always able to answer any questions in a fast and reliable manner. One note that must be mentioned about the great hospitality  the washerdryer broke during our stay and Carolyn and Margot had arranged for a new washerdryer to be delivered  this is amazing hospitality and it truly shows the great lengths the winder host and property manager go to to make their guests feel at home. I definitely recommend this place to anyone 
1519294,452649148806548293,2021-09-16,136351508,Sisa,Incredible sunset views over the ocean  while looking at the twelve apostles was truly unforgettable. The perfect stay
1519294,478742375828609340,2021-10-22,422724287,Mary,Great property with an amazing view   Loved our stay here and will return again 
1519294,489566705380018762,2021-11-06,178657380,Buyisiwe,It was good sitting in doors listening to waves
1519294,510588499417816004,2021-12-05,15072165,Yannick,Amazing place in a dreamy location. I missed the sound of the waves already. Enjoyed staying at Margots place  definitely recommend.
1519294,704865947842677055,2022-08-30,475859634,Mark,1010 for location. Lovely design and very spacious offering everything you need and more. For my wife's first time visit to SA  it was perfect.
1519294,714337817281047303,2022-09-12,18406687,Haneezka,Absolute wins The location  the view and the sound of the ocean If you are a couple or small family  this apartment has everything you need and more. Check-in is seamless too.  I would highly recommend and will definitely book again.
1519294,728785309427817446,2022-10-02,54864934,Brent,Best location in Cape Town with the most gorgeous views. A walk down to the beach along with the views of the best sunsets. Will definitely be back 
1519294,735351129049898478,2022-10-11,119121287,Russell,Great location and spectacular views. Compact  space suitable for a weekend away. The place needs a deep clean.
1996591,10056448,2014-01-27,5232882,Felix,Nice stay in a city apartment. James has everything arranged perfectly. It was like coming home
1996591,16307755,2014-07-25,17280119,Mitch,The Cape Town Loft was perfect It was in the centre of  town close walk to long st where there is heaps of restaurants for dinner and short drive to VA waterfront. The apartment was really nice and comfortable with everything an apartment needs with secure parking. We would stay here again if we come back to Cape Town.
1996591,18179890,2014-08-23,17909530,Aleksandra,The apartment was clean and well-prepared for our arrival. It is located in the centre of the city which can be noisy and crowdy at times. But on the positive side  it is very close to the major touristy attractions including my favourite Kloof street shopping and dining. The apartment is located in a building that is gated and well-secured do you feel safe. And the view that opens up from the apartment is just breathtaking We would wake up looking at Table mountain all lightened up by the sunrise - very beautiful. The apartment complex has a decent gym and a pool that we didn't use as it was too cold. Overall  great experience and and s very good apartment.
1519294,743243218945982859,2022-10-22,446921360,Tetyana,Amazing and beautiful condo. We had a magical time and plan to come back soon. Thank you
1519294,746852672710883535,2022-10-27,67369909,Chip,This place is amazing  What a great condo with an unbelievable view.  Easy access to the beach and Camps Bay.  Margot and Carolyn were both extremely communicative and very flexible.  I will stay for sure again the next time I'm in Cape Town.  We even extended for 1 day and they were super flexible.  Can't say enough good things.
1519294,757834056216384617,2022-11-11,2195127,Uli,Wir hatten einen traumhaften Aufenthalt in Margots Apartment. Die Lage ist nicht zu bertreffen. Es war noch viel schner als beschrieben. Ein Zuhause zum Wohlfhlen. Wir kommen sicher wieder.
1519294,772972015715397453,2022-12-02,21385764,Steven,Spectacular location as well as the unique architecture of the apartment itself.
1519294,886813271765458902,2023-05-08,88737242,Mara,Thank you for the nice stay. We loved it there. Margot and also Carolyne the check in women were super nice and always available. The apartment have a nice location and you can go directly to the beach.
1519294,897681328046800377,2023-05-23,17964605,Ahmed,Great location. Amazing views. Responsive communication. Second time to book and looking forward for the third. Thank you Margot
1519294,927329424476326256,2023-07-03,186697458,Neil,What an incredible place to spend a couple weeks. Winter in Cape Town isnt super busy but we had a special stay as the weather was spectacular and also always nice to be there with no one around cant wait to come back and the place is spectacular.
1519294,1001269091736800577,2023-10-13,28001884,Rachel,This is an amazing place Margot was helpful and communicative throughout booking and pre-travel  and Carolyn  the agent  was incredibly friendly and helpful and went out of her way to make our stay amazing  even allowing us to check out later than expected due to some unexpected meetings that popped up. The view is 1010 and the property is clean and comfortable. I would recommend a stay here to anyone wanting a lovely stay by the beach in Cape Town
1519294,1006395187934590886,2023-10-20,135995245,Emily,Margots place is a slice of Heaven.  Every morning upon awakening  I would look out to the sea and smile.  The sunsets from the balcony were also amazingly beautiful.  I found the location optimal.  My only complaint is of noisedust from construction occurring next door.  The host promised a 10 refund but wants to wait to issue it after the review period.
1519294,1018706319518716368,2023-11-06,57627370,Lisa,Perfect location on Clifton with private access to the beach and walkable to Camp's Bay shops and restaurants. We are a family of four including two adult children - the space was efficient and worked perfectly for us.
1519294,1028067047258422423,2023-11-19,457392498,Aubrey,The space is not as big as it appears on pictures  very nice and breath taking views you will also need to add a budget for cleaning if you are staying long. Load shedding in South Africa makes the entrance too dark at night  Also a lot of noise from the building construction  site next door. Overall I would give it a 710
1996591,20015723,2014-09-22,13391201,Zoe,The apartment was great Great location also. A short walk to some  nice shops and cafs. Amazing views of table mountain from both balconies The apartment has almost everything you could need  except for wifi. The wifi offered is a mobile phone which you have to put on hotspot and buy airtime for and was also flat when we arrived.. Better to use the wifi at a caf.
1996591,20256444,2014-09-26,2077606,Jd,The property itself is in really nice shape and was very comfortable to stay in.  I liked having the two level loft style place with the balconies  and the view was pretty good.  The location was very central and convenient  however  can be a little bit dodgy at certain hours.  It was a short walk to the central areas of Long and Kloof street and I found it quite easy to walk around.  It should be noted that this place does NOT include broadband wifi as listed.  James left a mobile phone that apparently could share its extremely slow internet connection.  Tracey  the manager  was nice enough to let me use her office to connect when I needed to.  If internet is important to you while you are traveling  as it was for me  take note that you will need to find it elsewhere.
1996591,20994455,2014-10-09,9181654,Kitty,Great apartment with stunning views and a good location to get to everything to see in the city. There's also a taxi rank right outside for longer journeys Clean apartment with a good kitchen  so you don't have to eat out everyday. Would definitely recommend.
1996591,21653405,2014-10-21,6412715,Susan,This is a beautiful  spacious place and the location is absolutely perfect  as it is centrally located to museums  a walking mall with wonderful places to eat  gardens. As we like to walk  we were able to walk to the waterfront area as well. It is extremely secure with two levels of security. The view is magnificent.
1996591,21944494,2014-10-27,20100645,Simon  Lucy,What a fantastic property. Spectacular views  excellent facilities pool and gym and perfect location - right in the heart of Cape Town. We had a wonderful stay and can't recommend this place enough. Many many thanks
1996591,22425681,2014-11-06,8646974,Mehmet,Everything was perfect. The view of Table Mountain  location of the house  and interior design were all perfect. All the description is correct and pictures are real. Adderley is the most central street in Cape Town and the residence is one of the most secure place. Thanks to James that he offers his gorgeous house to travelers.
1996591,23006270,2014-11-20,8130989,Namika,We had a wonderful stay at James' apartment. The reception from the security staff was great and they continued to be be friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The apartment itself is conveniently located in the city centre within walking distance from plenty of restaurants and a quick drive to all of the sites cape town has to offer. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would wholeheartedly recommend this apartment for anyone looking for a place to stay in the city that has an amazing view of table mountain.
1996591,24229986,2014-12-23,23431543,Jim,The internet was wonderful as well.
1996591,24581487,2014-12-31,21130739,David,It was an excellent experience  extremely well organised and accommodating. Beautiful views and wonderful facilities. 5 stars all the way
1996591,24811044,2015-01-03,5372584,Christine,James' flat in the centre of Cape Town is beautiful. The flat was wonderfully equipped. We were there on a very busy New Year's Eve and weren't bothered too much by the sounds from the street below because we had the patio doors open but the fan on to cool the place down - the view from both patios is amazing. We really wished to have more time to spend sitting around the pool in the complex. Highly recommended.
1996591,25130871,2015-01-07,15670878,Anders,Det var ltt att hitta till lgenheten och den lg vldigt bra till. Vi knner oss vldigt njda med vistelsen.
1996591,25536888,2015-01-19,20646791,Elise,Very nice apartment. The location is perfect.
1996591,26071581,2015-02-02,25869662,Alex,Great experience Centrally located flat that was incredibly convenient to all the major sites in and around Cape Town.
1557974,63385312,2016-02-22,52533305,Gladys,Jon was very concerned about our arrival and safety and offered to fetch us from the airport. This made us feel very welcome. Both Jon and his wife Suzi were available and accessible for any queries or advice about the area. My son and I felt welcome  safe and at peace in their lovely setting. A bonus especially for my son was being able to take their lovely soulful dog Sophie for walks in the beautiful park behind the house. I have stayed in a number of places over the past few months and this  by far  has been my best experience. Jon and Suzi allow privacy while being amiable and available.
1557974,204231377,2017-10-17,75537464,Juliana,Warm hospitality  perfect location in a very stylish secure house  close to all amenities  easy access to all motorways  so most main attractions were within half an hours drive including Cape Town
1996591,26902919,2015-02-22,2438371,James,The apartment is in a great location and the pool and building is great. The apartment itself was so nice and we felt really at home. Would recommend
1996591,27216239,2015-02-28,27151707,Capucine,We had a great experience at James' place we stayed there from 22 to 2 Feb 2015. James reacted immediately to our request and sent us relevant information to ensure a smooth check-in. The appartment was clean  functional  perfectly located close to Long and Kloof street and to Adderley bus station and with a stunning view of Table mountain. Everybody in the building was helpful and directions given were clear and precise. It was exactly what we expected and needed.
1996591,28199147,2015-03-20,6424180,Alain,We've had an absolutely wonderful stay of three weeks in James' apartment. The Adderley Terraces of which it's part boasts some great amenities  of which the pool - 15m and well equipped gym are especially noteworthy. The stunning views from both balconies on Table Mountain  Devil's Peak  District Six and CBD will be truly missed.  What an absolute joy to wake up to. The Terraces are very well maintained  have a high quality finish and some great staff. James  who we haven't met personally  left us in the very capable hands of Tracey  the manager  who would do everything in her power to make your stay comfortable. There's a very secure parking garage available for you to use as well although it takes you 39 tight corners to get to your bay. All in all  we'll certainly consider staying here again whenever we'll return to CT  which will be soon hopefully.
1996591,29855971,2015-04-13,29489586,Alessandro,The appartement was in a great shape and beautiful. It was clean and it had all household equipment you need for a perfect holiday. It is in the middle of the centre of CT and you have a wonderful view to the Table Mountain.
1996591,30892244,2015-04-28,25103526,Pia,Slap bang in the middle of town  just a walk away from all the city delights. Amazing views of the mountain. Do not miss visiting the Slave Lodge Museum next door  it was built in 1679 and is a crucial part of history.
1996591,32760114,2015-05-21,7781097,Sideeka,This is apartment is a must stay if you are going to be in Cape Town for some days.  Excellent central location  safe parking  clean  quiet and incredible views. I stayed here for 4 nights and it was worth it  very good value for your money. Don't have to worry at all about safety. James was very organized and responsive to all my questions. Everything is arranged in advance. Garage parking a bonus
1996591,37480125,2015-07-07,12044102,Anastasia,This apartment is located in the city center and near the railway station. The bus stop is just downstairs so it was very easy to get to the Table mountain. The apartment intself is exactly as on the photos  the view from the balcony is very beautiful. There is also an electrical heater in the apartment which saved us during chilly winter nights. We enjoyed our stay in James's apartment
1996591,37840891,2015-07-11,8123598,Brett,The apartment was great  and as described. It was such a convenient and secure location. We loved having the parking space included as well.
1557974,215336618,2017-11-29,68004510,Sahan,Overall It was a nice stay and the Host is very Helpful and welcoming.Situated in a very nice and secure neighborhood.can access any sight seeing location easily because very near to main highways.Great restaurants nearby and a quite big shopping village that included almost everything you will need.
1557974,421293804,2019-03-09,41175940,Rick,If you are staying in Cape Town you can't go wrong here
1557974,440736654,2019-04-21,146010539,Chris,Jons place is amazing I wish I could have stayed longer.
1557974,593546566,2020-01-16,75537464,Juliana,Very comfortable accommodation  spacious  relaxing atmosphere  lots of local knowledge on tap to make the most of our stay.
1557974,610786897,2020-02-25,209005042,Celeste,Lovely room in a beautiful house and so perfectly located and central to everything Cape Town has to offer. Tranquility and peace awaits you.
1996591,38499259,2015-07-16,15834899,Tristan,James was great with providing us all the details before our arrival and giving us some great suggestions on places to eat. The apartments was clean and neat as it appears in the pictures. The place has great views of Table Mountain  centrally located to lots of shops  museums  and restaurants. Secure building with all the amenities. Would stay here again
1996591,39225519,2015-07-21,35030109,Thomas,Excellent place  just as described. Really the perfect location in Cape Town. Everything went very smoothly for both check in and check out  despite the fact that I arrived very late on my day of arrival
1557974,820073868671357276,2023-02-05,124936739,Terry,I had booked with Jon as there was a pool. Unfortunately it wasn't ready for swimming which was disappointing. Everything else was great. Safe  quiet  comfortable.
1557974,825138090196127411,2023-02-12,108889228,Laura,A wonderful experience- beautiful garden  lovely and comfortable accommodations  extremely kind  helpful  considerate hosts  great communication before and during our stay. The location is ideal for exploring the area- close to everything and the property is very secure.
1996591,42077447,2015-08-10,12748240,Celia,The appartment is ideally situated and secure. It's a perfect location to  spend few days in CP. James is a great host 
1558929,8254449,2013-10-22,1036129,Abhi,Great location next to water. Felt safe and secure with guards. Apartment was clean and very convenient location. Staff in building was friendly and helpful.
1996591,43751817,2015-08-22,10304772,Gene,This loft in the heart of city center was comfortable  light and airy and the host as well as the staff of the building were truly helpful and very easy to communicate. It is easy walking distance to all the major attractions of Cape Town and the city bus stops right out front. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and highly recommend it.
1558929,13607475,2014-06-01,3553892,Tanya  Marc,This flat was fantastic a real home away from home.  Garth and Sharne were excellent hosts and very prompt in returning our calls and answering questions. This is the first time we've stayed in Mouille Point usually stay in Sea Point and we much prefer the location here.  There was plenty of parking and great access to all of the places we typically visit. We would definitely stay here again.
1558929,20440618,2014-09-29,10953032,Yvette,A cute little place Clean and tidy.  Can be a little noisy during the day with neighbours. Great location with awesome views. Couple of good restaurants near bye  hop on hope off bus stop close and park on both sides Walking distance to VA.  Garth and Sharne where very helpful when we required anything for the apartment. Thanks for a comfortable stay.
1558929,21660430,2014-10-21,20435788,Francois,Fantastic address. Brilliant location. Everything just like it said on the tin. All went well. We will go back.
1558929,22322765,2014-11-03,22542637,Carla,I loved the apartment it was just as pictured. The location was great we so enjoyed taking morning walks along the water. Since it was residential there was easy access to many shops  eateries  markets  and restaurants. The apartment was located very close to the VandA Waterfront which we walked to daily.  The hosts need to be more accommodating. Hosts should have contact with guests to asure all necessary needs are met during their stay.
1558929,25850739,2015-01-27,25533066,Herman,Excellent appartement  1015 min walk from Waterfront and close to bus stations. Appartement is well equipped and so is the kitchen. Good service and friendly welcome. Closest supermarket we found is at waterfront and is huge. Quick response from Garth if you have anything to ask. We had a great time here
1558929,30601059,2015-04-25,26357004,Carl N.,The experience was great overall I arrived late at night  but pre-communication was great  such that my check-in was smooth. The apartment was stocked with tea  coffee  and yummy treats  which was really nice of the hosts. Parking was great lot next door and no hassle. The apartment was lovely  in a super and beautifulscenic location - I think it beat staying in the CBD. There were several nearby eateries  slightly on the pricier end for Cape Town  but good quality and service. No AC in the apartment  but there was a nice and cool sea breeze entire time  and lots of fans. Hosts were very accommodating by sending over a cleaning person midway through my stay for a reasonable fee payable directly to the cleaner. WiFi was SUPER fast. Watch out for intermittent electricity power outages - the door man can give you a schedule.
1558929,32700377,2015-05-20,4302668,Emily,Great apartment in a perfect location.  Restaurant across the street  walk along the promenade at Mouille point or to the VA waterfront.  Cute place  well furnished  has everything you need.
1558929,38908621,2015-07-19,1607003,Zaid,This apartment is lovely and so central to town. The neighborhood is fantastic with partial sea views and mountain views with a lovely balcony to take it all in. The apartment had everything that a traveller needs   most importantly a comfortable bed  and great shower. It was decorated nicely and was close to good restaurants and the waterfront shopping mall. Highly recommended
1996591,45361789,2015-09-02,26032756,Gerry,We had an amazing time at James' apartment  well appointed and in a great location  felt very local  wonderful views of Table Mountain  and close to Company Gardens  and 1 block from Slave Lodge.  Not far from great restaurants.  Can recommend.
1996591,47029804,2015-09-15,17640174,Dana,Very responsive host.  Check in and out was very easy.
1996591,49098033,2015-10-01,9187125,Mark,Nice apartment in city centre. Top floor  so it can be a bit windy Very safe  you have to pass two security guards to get to your apartment. It was vert easy to contact James or the lady that manages the building. It was even possible to check-out in the evening. Very kind of James.
1996591,49873550,2015-10-07,30219776,Michael,Alles bestens geklappt  sehr hilfsbereite Angestellte  komplett eingerichtete Wohnung mit sensationeller Aussicht auf den Tafelberg und super Lage im Zentrum. Wohnung im Oktober teilweise etwas khl  Elektroradiatoren vorhanden. Gerne jederzeit wieder.
1996591,50174423,2015-10-10,34489221,Dana,James was good at communicating prior to our arrival but I was very disappointed at what we found when we arrived. The flat was tired looking and quite dirty  especially the bathroom and the lounge rug. I contacted James and he put me in touch with onsite management who  to be fair  did arrange more cleaning and was very helpful. I was however angry at having to take time from our holiday to request  this and also tarnish the remaining days we had of an otherwise amazing holiday. The flat has not been maintained to a high standard nor has there been much consideration for the comfort of the guests. All in all very disappointing and I would not recommend the property.
1996591,51261260,2015-10-19,28662737,Prisca,We spent 7 nights in James apartment and it was perfect. The location is central and very secure. The apartment very well equiped and comfortable. The view from the balconies day and night is amazing
1996591,51735382,2015-10-24,24899106,Kerstin,Nice Appartement  excellent view and the pool is very nice  too. A couple of things in the apt could be looked after  like a broken fan or a clogged sink. We stayed for 3 nights. Though we never met James in person  Tracy was well informed and highly welcoming  and also showed us the parking spot. James provided detailed information after our booking  which was very useful. We really enjoyed our time in Capetown
1996591,53470962,2015-11-09,44278206,Alistair,Excellent flat and location James was fantastic in making sure everything was prepared for us and made sure everything was OK while we were there. The three nights were a great end to an amazing stay in Cape Town. Thanks James
1996591,53872990,2015-11-14,12817850,Renate,Dear James and Tracey. We like to thank you for your help before and during our stay. We really enjoyed staying in the loft which is so convenient located in Cape Town. If we return we now where to stay and recommend your place to our friends
1996591,54790547,2015-11-23,48938213,Sally,Wonderful clean  spacious  central apartment. Excellent communication by James and it was a pleasure to stay.
1996591,55094078,2015-11-28,4676966,Emmanuelle,This apartment is centrally located downtown. Walking distance from many attractions  and fairly close to the main tourist sights by car. The apartment is spacious and has your needs. We also appreciated having a parking spot free of charge and that the building has security. I would recommend this apartment if you are used to Airbnb accommodations and a self sufficient guest.
1996591,55715069,2015-12-05,14897705,Doris,The accomodation is located in the city centre and perfect for the first visit in Cape Town.  The apartment is tastefully furnished and offers a very nice view from both balconies on the table mountain. The communication with James was direct and uncomplicated. The building is guarded and we felt very safe at every time. We can fully recommend this place.
1996591,57750703,2015-12-29,31906233,Sarianna,Erinomainen sijainti  upeat nkymt Table Mountainille. Asunto on tilava ja siisti. Yhteydenpito Jamein kanssa sujui vaivattomasti. Suosittelen.
1996591,58766097,2016-01-05,466264,Jesse,The view is stunning  the apartment has a nice modern aspect  the pool is a great bonus  the location is convenient to many of the city's attractions  and James is quite responsive. The only disappointment was the difficulty of getting the place to cool down granted  it was a heat wave  but the way the unit is built you can't really get a cross-breeze in the loft where the bed is. So long as you're going in another season  and so long as you realize that staying in the CBD has you rubbing shoulders with a broad spectrum of the city's residents  I can recommend without hesitation.
1558929,92266506,2016-08-08,85595948,Tshepo,Absolutely perfect.. All you need.. Very friendly
1558929,110592668,2016-10-27,98957469,Kate,Had a great time will definitely be back.

1558929,140881006,2017-04-01,1098766,Patricia,A wonderful stay at Gordon's flat in Mouille Point.  It was a great location With every convenience. Excellent security.  Great energy there.  Reliable internet  grocery shopping steps away.
1558929,143313190,2017-04-11,11335609,Tony,Awsome location. Very central.
1558929,147362020,2017-04-26,17563789,Kayleigh,A lovely  clean  comfortable apartment on the seafront. Fabulous location for a few days in Cape Town We really enjoyed our stay.
1558929,151500461,2017-05-13,3553892,Tanya  Marc,This was our second great stay at this flat. Everything went very smoothly. Great location with ample parking. Several new restaurants in the area. Wifi was excellent. Couldn't ask for more.
1558929,202428295,2017-10-11,140545281,Ursula,Great location and really nice flat.
1558929,222919067,2017-12-31,26549765,Gayle,Great little flat in a perfect location. Very secure building with 24 hr porter. The flat was spotless on arrival and we had a bowl of apples  milk and juice in the fridge - very nice touch Hosts are super responsive even over public holidays. The furniture is a little old fashioned - chairs a bit creaky - but bed very comfortable. Better for a couple rather than 4 people as the sofabed is a bit snug. Many thanks - we had a fabulous holiday.
1558929,224790226,2018-01-04,135095067,Ken,Nice location and nice facility. We would like to stay again.
1558929,228484966,2018-01-20,120753759,Alice,Great location  accommodation needs updating especially the chairs  there is no secure parking with this property.
1558929,248837290,2018-04-01,139577577,Vaughan,Fantastic apartment which is close to the waterfront and centrally located Thanks for a great stay.
1558929,280373634,2018-06-23,25681353,Andrew,Our fourth visit to this apartment. Very convenient location and a comfortable place to stay.
1996591,59686311,2016-01-14,25187746,Laura,Our stay in James' apartment was great. Very central location and well proportioned accomodation  very good value for money.
1996591,61477485,2016-02-05,46557014,Pippa,This modern apartment was the perfect place to stay in the heart of CapeTown on our first visit to South Africa. It is at the top of a block so has lovely views especially of Table Mountain but also has a second layer of security midway up the block which is reassuring for first timers - although its important to say we never felt unsafe at any time during our stay. Liaison with Tracey at the Adderley on arrival was efficient and seamless and having a car parking spot was GREAT  as was having the use of the pool at a very hot time of year. The apartment is on two levels  kitchen  living room  loo  and terrace on one  and bedroom  nice modern bathroom with bath and shower and terrace above. Lovely to sit outside with a drink after a meal at the VA Waterfront. During the weekend there was a music festival only a block or so away so we got a free concert too The music didn't go on very late  but anyway with the windows closed the apartment was really quiet  amazing right in the heart of the city  we had a very peaceful few nights and we slept brilliantly - the bed is lovely and big. There is an open-top-bus stop right outside the building  and a taxi rank  so when we didn't want to use our car it was perfect. All the Adderley staff were very helpful - would thoroughly recommend this apartment and would stay there again. Thanks James.
1558929,465619935,2019-06-08,123821331,Tracy,Great place. Across the road from the ocean and km's of Promenade to go walking. I loved staying there. Home away from home.
1558929,667950165,2020-09-26,8115145,Jacques,Dont get tricked into staying here. The location is good but the apartment is a total rip-off. Much better value nearby. This host promised us a refund and tricked us into cancelling and then blocked all communication. Not fair.
1558929,747728483,2021-04-11,4114116,H.L.,good apartment with great location great host
1558929,755738600,2021-05-07,35679146,Brigid,Lovely stay - thank you .

1558929,464948254808648212,2021-10-03,222825565,Danielle,We spent 10 days in this flat  and loved it. The location is perfect across the road from the sea-front promenade  a very short walking distanct to the entrance to Green Point Urban Park and a choice of excellent coffee shops all around. The flat itself is well-equipped  the bed and seating area very comfortable  and the shower instantly hot . Sharne and Grant handled all communication very fast and checked that we were happily settled. We'll be back
1558929,471509442260977030,2021-10-12,157096556,Brian,Staying here was a pleasure. Well appointed apartment  close to restaurants and the promenade. Great views of Signal Hill. Picking up the keys from the lock box made checking in simple. The security guards at reception where very helpful.
1558929,530256907309906553,2022-01-01,191526849,Garth,I had the most amazing stay in Cape Town  thanks to Gordon and his team . The place felt like home and was really well located
1558929,534537776280957242,2022-01-07,41628968,Grant,Great location  furniture very old and needs replacing.  Without the curtains being closed there is no privacy.

1558929,678005486607174794,2022-07-24,268529387,Morne,Great value for money. The unit is situated on the promonade and all attractions in Sea PointMouille Point area.
1996591,62793571,2016-02-17,3117743,Catherine,This property is located right in the heart of downtown Cape town  with stunning views of table mountain. The staff that helped us check in and check out were very helpful and accommodating. The physical aspects of the property are exactly as advertised. This apartment was on the 12th floor and you would need to take two separate elevators with a traversing walk between them to get to the place. A bit of a pain and some people would probably complain  but worth it for the views
1996591,63696092,2016-02-26,50578707,Kaval,We really enjoyed our stay here. It really is a beautiful place. Clean  spacious  plenty of natural light  great views of table mountain from the balconies and centrally located. We didn't get a chance to use the gym or pool but both looked very good. Thank you very much.
1996591,64207071,2016-03-01,15828600,Michele,We had a fantastic time in Cape Town. The flat and location are superb. The pool is great  the flat has amazing views and has everything you would need. Highly recommend staying here.

1996591,65981306,2016-03-18,60494675,Jay,The apartment was absolutely perfect for my Cape Town trip. Conveniently located in the heart of CPT with stunning views of Table Mountain and easy access to bus tours  flea markets and the Waterfront. The pictures and description don't do it justice - lavishly furnished and stocked with great style.

Across the street from a cute coffee shop that is also open late for drinks and food.  the Ocean is right across the street with a great walking path.  The price was reasonable.  My only critique is that it got a little cold.  But overall  great experience

Visiting Albatross House in the dead of winter  the space was surprisingly cosy and warm.  We woke up to stunning views over the Simonstown Harbour and False Bay  with snow on the horizon mountains. Yet we could sit ouside on the balcony and bask in the sun.  We'll definitely be back.
1571355,454800857588165191,2021-09-19,226151893,Jeandre,Lovely location. Beautiful views and well equipped. Couldnt ask for more for the day.

1571355,941871177328282371,2023-07-23,118358724,Ayesha,I didn't expect such a peaceful comfortable stay. The kitchendining area is between the two bedrooms and opens to the veranda.Each room also has its own door to the wide veranda overlooking the magnificent view of the ocean and Harbour. A simple and very effective layout ideal for two couples or a family of four. A few steps to gain access so not advised for anyone who struggles with steps though one can gain easier access from above the property. For those views-I was happy to navigate with bags. I had a great stay and Andre and his parents are very kind people who leave you in complete privacy to switch off. Thank you again.
1571355,952008624881555862,2023-08-06,13938815,Salomien,Lovely apartment with expansive veranda and gorgeous views of the bay and a lovely indigenous garden. Only wish we stayed longer than one night to enjoy it more. Clear instructions for contactless check in.

1571355,1038260342454787742,2023-12-03,179967294,Sion,Comfortable stay for our family with two kids. The view is uncredible and theres a massive balcony to enjoy it from. Location is right on top of the hill overlooking the harbour. Very peaceful and quiet day and night. Will come again

1996591,122218117,2016-12-22,60340115,Thomas,The condo has a great location  very close to Bree St. It is perfect for a long weekend stay and to enjoy the city. The staff is friendly and polite. Innthe summer it can get quite warm you have to leave the windows open and turn on the fans.
1996591,125323330,2017-01-05,16468085,Frank,Views of Table Mountain were superb. Apartment was as described. Thanks for a great stay.

Good pool and friendly staff in the Terraces.  Supermarkets nearby as well as bus stop right outside for Table Mountain and other attractions.  Walking tours started 5 mins away.  Jazz club 3 mins away and loads of coffee shops.  No air conditioning meant using the three fans and having doors open.  Used Uber at night  quick and reasonable.  Good introduction to wonderful Cape Town.
1996591,130635040,2017-02-07,99822159,Wolfgang,Schne Unterkunft in zentraler Lage mit Aussicht auf den Tafelberg. Schafraum in oberer Etage schn  war im Februar etwas warm.

1587516,604106172,2020-02-10,87116390,Jean-Pierre,Our family enjoyed our stay at Tanyas unit. We appreciate the attention to detail and would recommend it to any future visitors.

Perfect location - highly recommended
1996591,131977412,2017-02-15,6007275,Carolyn,Excellent apartment you can sit on the balcony looking a table top mountain. It has the use of a lovely swimming pool and gym  it is very secure and the apartment itself is spacious for a 1 bedroom with all facilities you need to enjoy your stay. I have no hesitation in recommending this apartment
1996591,133542031,2017-02-23,44652050,Ella,We had a brilliant stay at this air bnb. The location is so central for everything in Cape Town- long street is a quick walk away  there is a bus stop for camps bay right outside the hotel. The apartment itself was very clean  modern and had a brilliant view of table mountain. The only thing like everyone else says on the reviews was the air conditioning as there is none- ours was particularly windy week so we couldn't have the doors open which meant it was quite hot but we were expecting that from the reviews. James was very quick to respond to our queries. We loved our stay and would recommend it to everyone.
1996591,134831941,2017-03-01,92172074,Franco Und Marlies,We have had a great time in James' loft. The loft is in the very heart of Cape Town  the view is absolutely amazing  all the staff at the reception are helpful. We will come back....
1996591,135103248,2017-03-03,117218533,Kelli,I absolutely loved my stay here. I would definitely book again next time I come to Cape Town
1996591,135467076,2017-03-05,64184092,Liad,Really cool penthouse-like place in the city. Gorgeous view and very central.
1996591,136319027,2017-03-10,30333689,Carla,Great apartment for a stay in Cape Town. Good location for Bree street etc. The apartment and the block had all the facilities you need including a decent gym and a nice pool. The only slightly annoying thing was that the parking space is on the last floor of the block which meant having to drive up and down for 5 mins to get in and out. But we got used to it.
1996591,151266920,2017-05-12,71474538,Kevin,Beautiful views
1996591,152930395,2017-05-19,47208108,Patrick,Excellent apartment and great value. The location was a perfect base for exploring Cape Town. We had a rental car which was safe in the attached and secured parking garage for days we did not use it. There's really no need for one unless you are doing a daytrip out to the suburbs or Cape Point which we did. And the balcony is a great spot for sitting outside with a drink before heading off to dinner. Highly recommend
1996591,154331031,2017-05-24,65484095,Eric,Everything was great during our stay. Highly suggest uber or taxi when leavingreturning at night. Apartment was clean and had great views. Very comfortable as well.

1996591,182238935,2017-08-14,2146438,Martine,James' modern and will fitted apartment is absolutely beautiful  with two balconies with great view on Table Mountains. There is everything one needs and more we stayed 6 days  but could have stayed much longer kitchen is well equiped  beautiful bathroom  VERY comfortable bed plenty of closets and so tasteful and spotless. The building  such interesting architecture is very secure guardians are friendly and helpful. Museums basic shopping and Long street are all walking distance for the Gardens or Waterfront areas  one will need to take cabs... But the neighborhood was perfect for us. Thanks..

Nothing like the view of Table Mountain from the bed  James was extremely quick to respond and to provide local tips.  Really happy with the stay. Thanks James

Everything in the apartment is as described and it has great views of table mountain from 2 nice balconies. Only problem was we didn't get to use it as much as we would have liked as there is so much to do in Cape Town Would love to return again. Great communication throughout the process. I would highly recommend.
1996591,221859320,2017-12-28,69392917,India,James's apartment met all of our needs for my husband and I  and James himself was a very responsive and accommodating host. The apartment was a large  modern space with two balconies and a great view of table mountain. The building was extremely secure with multiple key fob entries and security guards at each entrance. We arrived late in the evening on Christmas Eve night and I was worried about finding food  groceries to have for the few days we were there. But James was a huge help  leaving some snack foods and fruit for us. He recommended a few places to grab coffee and eat on Christmas day as well  which we tried out.  All in all we had a great stay
1996591,223467418,2018-01-01,32484077,Amin,A location in the heart of everything Cape Town has to offer. Two stories with balconies boasting spectacular views of the skyline and Table Mountain. Amenities included coffee  new quality appliances  bath and shower  and clean  soft towels and sheets. James was responsive  and even facilitated an early check-in. Many thanks for making our first experience one to remember - we will be back

1595157,10133369,2014-02-02,8726096,Roger,Beautiful views over False Bay - rather a climb up to the property but worth it. No TV but DVD player available.
1595157,11299797,2014-03-29,3100293,Nikolaus,Cape Point Cottage was absolutely lovely. There is a great attention to detail and everything you could want - an outdoor grill  a wood burning oven   a fabulous bathroom  sweeping ocean views  a comfortable bed  a well-stocked kitchen and exceptionally kind hosts.

1595157,150204693,2017-05-07,29499776,Nina,It looked beautiful on the pictures  but it's even more beautiful in real life. We loved the layout of the cottage. The fire was burning when we arrived  and there is nothing more cozy and inviting than that. We stayed there with our 1 and 3 year old and for them it was magical. Seeing the mountain and the ocean  lots of steps and a great jungle gym. We will definitely go again.
1595157,195908153,2017-09-21,42833486,Helen,Lovely view of the ocean  beautiful garden and tranquil accommodation. Highly recommended.

1595157,227518117,2018-01-15,15403211,Eva,This is such a gem of a place We stayed for four nights  and wish we could've stayed longer. The pictures don't do it justice - the view is incredible  the two patios are lovely  and the staff on site are wonderful. We visited nearby Cape Point Nature Reserve a few times during our stay  and were glad to be staying close enough that we could beat the crowds. Thank you  Rosalind
1595157,235261422,2018-02-16,102778927,Susan,This perfect cottage exceeded all of our expectations. The location and view are stunning and convenient for exploring Cape Point and all of the small towns along the Indian Ocean. The cottage was sparkling clean and we appreciated the hiking trails  candlelit nights and lovely patios. We cant wait to return
1996591,284810281,2018-07-02,69987668,Marian,Lovely  clean loft with  a great view of Table Mountain.  Location is in a more diverse area of the city center but good security measures at the Adderly location.  Very close to the  beautiful Company Gardens .

1996591,327100693,2018-09-23,26557963,Carly,This apartment was a great central spot to stay in Cape Town. The view alone made this a stunner At the top of a very safe and secure building the apartment was super spacious and I would for sure recommend this place if you want to stay in the city centre.
1996591,329529458,2018-09-29,17156058,Marion,Great location and wonderful view You can experience almost everything from this place A bit fresh in spring time  but it is no problem during night. Highly recommended

1996591,342030300,2018-10-28,52980342,Sabrina,The appartement was great and the view of Table Mountain was stunning The location is great but if you travel alone as a woman as I did I might not suggest it
1996591,346543608,2018-11-09,62243973,Jill,A great place to stay in the centre of Cape Town. The apartment was as described and had everything we needed for our 4 night stay. James answered my queries very quickly  . I would definitely recommend this as an excellent base from which  to explore the city.
1996591,349002446,2018-11-16,191154657,Lauren,James' apartment is stylish and has stunning views of table mountain. There is a taxi rank situated right outside  with the VA Waterfront being a 10 min drive away depending on traffic. It's central location is near the long street hop-on-hop-off bus stop and Company Gardens. James also kept in regular contact to ensure everything was ok during our stay.
1595157,238566494,2018-02-26,51247818,Ania,There is just enough light to see inside the cottage  plenty of candles is you prefer it cosy.
1595157,265239779,2018-05-16,12055145,Dick,Zelden in zon mooi  bijzonder en romantisch huisje op zon prachtige plek verbleven. Kaarsjes  bad  open haard. Spectaculair uitzicht op de oceaan. Wel tijdig inkopen doen om zelf te kunnen koken  winkels op enige afstand. Verde prima uitvalsbasis voor een bezoek aan Kaap de Goede Hoop.
1595157,334089170,2018-10-08,15986386,Rina,Beautiful cottage Amazing view of ocean and mountain  with nice trail from the cottage. Very close to cape point and boulders beach pinguins. Also lovely visit to Simons town. We were received very kindly and the house was looked after when we were gone. You will not regret staying here for sure
1595157,337378418,2018-10-16,144687,Paul,Even better than the photographs
1595157,345819193,2018-11-06,131670174,Trevor,Well equipped rustic feeling cottage in a great location with an ocean view and nice outside areas. Short drive to Simons Town which is a fascinating place with an active navy base and thus lots of history and character. Also easy striking distance to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point.
1595157,347892794,2018-11-12,40363357,Bridget,Amazing spot
1595157,354641210,2018-12-02,4880411,Theunes,Excellent service
1595157,360300857,2018-12-20,35266304,Andrew,A beautiful environmentally sensitive hide-away from the City. Mountain and sea all in super-comfortable ease.
1595157,407769330,2019-02-03,160603075,Sean,Great place. And the views are amazing. Worth the trip and close to all the surrounding areas
1595157,408953389,2019-02-06,6445371,Lili,Absolutely stunning location in arguably the most beautiful stretch of road in the Cape. You dont come for design or luxury  you come here for a getaway  to let the wind and water and mountain clear your head.  Runnerbikeryogihikers dream. The little cottage is tucked into the mountain if you like a nestled feeling but the showstopper is the main house  which has stunning panoramic views of all of False Bay from the bedroom and bath tub.  Rosalind was super helpful and generous in moving me from the cabin to the house when the water heater broke as they do.  Would love to come back and soak in the view again. FYI you need your own car  there are friendly dogs on the property and its a short hike up to the house.
1595157,418946948,2019-03-03,12662829,Stephen,Lovely get away from Cape Town . Tranquil setting great service
1595157,426138937,2019-03-20,28537127,Simone,Such a beautiful space. Absolutely everything you need  and the most remarkable light.
1595157,437239891,2019-04-14,142531107,Andrew,Off the grid cabin  tucked away in a beautiful garden above road  shared by 2 other cabins but offering great privacy. Fire place a win  with amazing views of mountain from bed and sea from lounge. Great marked walks into mountain. Will be back
1595157,444590824,2019-04-28,143444831,Bruce,This is a piece of heaven. We loved our stay here
1595157,482282197,2019-07-06,54748417,Alejandra,This is a one of a kind experience  surrounded by nature  highly recommended
1595157,487827659,2019-07-14,19328962,Steffi,We had a wonderful stay at the cottage  the view is wonderful. The kids loved the ature walks and the dogs. A really nice place.
1595157,516341671,2019-08-24,155089012,Melissa,This is a beautiful off the grid cottage...but solar powered and with all the mod-cons.  The view is wonderful and the location is ideal for exploring Simon Town and Cape of Good Hope.
1595157,520215687,2019-08-30,96162788,Kirstie,A homely and most comfortable stay with THE most amazing view. Loved being off the grid and being surrounded by candlelight.
1595157,529797596,2019-09-15,240774911,Schalk,Highly recommended. A wonderful getaway  stunning views  cosy and close to nature.
1595157,544077266,2019-10-09,296634281,Nick,This place is a bit out of town but that is its absolute beauty. A rustic charm of peace and quiet with all the amenities you would like hen travelling. It is a wonderful setting when lit by candles and all that can be heard is the roll of the sea and the weather. A truly great place to stay.
1595157,558477837,2019-11-03,22140419,Margaret,Very clean  amazing craftsmanship  sweeping ocean views  gorgeous walkways. Tarisai was extremely helpful and thoughtful and his coworker helped carry our luggage up the stairs  A wonderful way for us to recuperate and relax after what felt like 3 days of traveling to arrive in this beautiful country an 11 hour and 13 hour flight.  Also  our first night here we enjoyed being able to unwind and relax in the bath surrounded by candlelight. Absolutely one of my favourite places ever.  The two dogs we met were adorable and friendly - so sweet  It was lovely being surrounded by all the jungle greenery and ocean views. Highly recommend this place
1996591,356152243,2018-12-07,182735044,Simone,Wir waren eine Woche in diesem Appartement und waren begeistert von der Lage  der Wohnung  dem Blick auf den Tafelberg und der hervorragenden Kommunikation mit dem Gastgeber. Es hat alles super geklappt und wir wrden immer wieder kommen.
1996591,362412077,2018-12-26,23261619,Fran,This apartment is pretty much spot-on. Location wise you are close to all the bars and restaurants  and walking distance to the Waterfront if you can be bothered with the walk only about R30 for an uber if youd rather not walk. It has a pool which is great for chilling during the day although only 4 sunloungers this actually didnt prove to be an issue  and plenty of sunshine all day. A downstairs loo and upstairs bathroom is really helpful  and the kitchen contains everything you would need. Superb views of Table Mountain from both balconies were a winning point for us. All in all  a really good stay
1996591,367193395,2019-01-04,26695324,Mary,Really enjoyed  our stay at James' apartment. Nicely laid out  lots of space  great views in a really secure building. Staff at both receptions were really helpful and friendly.  Nice surprise to have the swimming pool open given I have received a mail saying due to the ongoing water shortage  it would be closed. Nice touch to have pool towels provided separately. My only critique was for 2 ladies traveling on their own  there were  2 evenings when the road outside was closed to traffic which meant we were not able to Uber door to door which did make us feel uncomfortable walking the final part of our way home late in the evening - not to be recommended. Uber is highly recommend as the way to get around the city and beyond  reliable and affordable.
1996591,406827896,2019-01-31,28592211,Franz,Trs bon emplacement et terrasse agrable. Piscine agrable. Accs  la place de parking un peu fastidieux.
1996591,409568485,2019-02-08,53775158,Elyce,A comfortable stay  nestled in the heart Cape Town on the edge of CBD.  Ideal for if you need to be centrally located great combo of a hideaway in the mix. The condo complex offers a lovely private  community vibe when enjoying the pool and opportunity to interact with locals and travelers.
1996591,411004341,2019-02-11,48518661,Tracy,We had a lovely stay in this comfortable apartment  very centrally located  with gorgeous views. It was easy to communicate with James and the staff at the apartment building were friendly and helpful.
1996591,423163610,2019-03-13,35290037,Oly,Sometimes you hit it right.  And with James place we did.  Without any knowledge of location or neighborhood or local features we were shooting blind except for the ratings.  What a great experience    Great location near walking distance to many of the areas and attractions you will want to see - and easy access to transport for those a bit further away.  Security was a top concern and we felt very comfortable with the secure building and of course being in the penthouse.  Take it - you will love it and move on to your other tasks knowing this one is done.  The views of Table Top are great from both balconies and nice to wake up looking out at it.
1996591,431941807,2019-04-02,104595904,Zo Aphra,James appartment is exactly as described. A very secure building in Cape Town city centre with amazing views. The location is great for eateries and transport links. Lovely comfy bed. The car park space provided came in very useful. James was very quick to respond to any messages I sent him. WHEN we return to Cape Town on holiday  I will be looking up this apartment to stay in again.
1595157,567290654,2019-11-22,23689906,Grant,If you like nature and quite while still being accessible to town this is the place to be. Spectacular location Spotlessly clean Super hospitality Thank you
1595157,577865608,2019-12-16,135082136,Justin,Great cottage in lovely location.
1595157,593515710,2020-01-16,15195950,Jeff,Great location to escape... perfect for a writer who wants to get away from it all or a couple that just wants some alone time.  Truly off the grid for electric and water. The kitchen supplies were a nice surprise. It's still a cabin feel but really so much more The proximity to both Cape Point and Simon's Town was great.  A very distinctive and unique property. The strong winds at night and the warm temperatures were a little more than expected but still I would highly recommend this place for people who just need to escape.
1595157,607595991,2020-02-18,335601071,Elijah,Lovely cottage nestled into the side of the mountain - you'll encounters birds and butterflies while drinking coffee and enjoy a stunning view of the ocean waters. Beautiful spot  lovely hospitality.
1595157,608218678,2020-02-20,24134574,Nelson,A great cottage on the coast. It was lovely with the wind blowing and cooking in the candlelight.  A wonderful place to stay if your going to Cape Point early in the Morning.
1595157,608680791,2020-02-21,141576442,Wouter,A beautiful location with the best view.  A very romantic place

1595157,619790233,2020-03-19,470385,Alexandra,A nice little nock to hide away and stare at the ocean for hours. Lovely little cottage with everything you need. We enjoyed every bit if it.
1595157,620421872,2020-03-22,2968728,Karla,Beautiful little cottage on the side of the mountain. Gorgeous bedroom and bathroom off the grid with stone walls. Stunning beaches and mountain walks nearby. Wish our stay was longer
1595157,631649702,2020-06-23,41551373,Wade,We were in desperate need of a weekend away and Rosalinds place really did the trick It was lovely to have an expansive view of the ocean while sitting by the fire  or cooking in the open and well-stocked kitchen. Rosalinds place really is tucked away in the mountain and the energy of nature and sea is overwhelming. Special thank you to Ayanda and Tarisai for making our stay extra special.
1595157,655201846,2020-08-23,325901657,Lukas,Had an amazing stay with my girlfriend  walked down to Smitswinkle beach. The staff where super helpful on the property helping whenever needed. Beautiful house with lush nature.
1595157,710467976,2020-11-22,21392230,Mari  Joshua,We couldnt have loved this more. One of the best stays weve had in the world The view is mesmerising  the ocean is so close by and the dogs are a delight. There are wonderful short hikes behind the house and at night you go to sleep to the the sound of a river and sweetly croaking frogs. We will definitely be back.
1595157,713675813,2020-12-06,32481222,Rob,Beautiful cottage  highly recommended

1595157,718649240,2020-12-27,179940306,Celeste,An absolutely magical trip Cannot wait to be back soon. Thank you for the wonderful hospitality Rosalind and Tersai
1595157,719998076,2020-12-31,132502323,Chelsea,The cottage is enchanting  peaceful and immersed in nature with an exquisite view. The ambiance is warm and cosy and everything we needed was in the space. It certainly is a hidden gem for some downtime.
1595157,720733221,2021-01-02,21392230,Mari  Joshua,A wonderful stay as usual. What a treat

1595157,483837341851035499,2021-10-29,383018504,Mehmet,Where do I begin to describe this heaven on earth  words will not do justice. Nestled between the majestic backdrop of the mountains and the ocean is this gem  which offers the perfect escape  exactly what I needed. You receive water that is pure from the mountains and the cleanest air possible with gorgeous mornings  there is no place like it among various Airbnbs I tried in Cape Town. Cape of Good Hope National Park is at your doorstep and the gorgeous beach of the Swinkelssmith Bay is on the way with many other breathtaking hiking possibilities  and Simonstown is a 5 minute drive if you need anything. My first day here  I made friends with the most wonderful dogs possible who took me on a walk up to the mountains  such a special treat this was. But they are very well behaved and will keep their distance if you are allergic. Even more than this beautiful place  I am grateful to have met these beautiful hosts. I was fortunate to spend time with Joel before Roz arrived  and he is one of the most gentle souls I have met in my journey. I learned so much about South Africa and its history from his unique perspective Roz and Joel were most accommodating and did everything possible to make my stay perfect. Also a very special thanks to Tarisai who is on the property to answer to any needs you may have including laundry and cleaning. He is very responsive and respectful. I have collected beautiful memories here and hope to be back one day. Thank you
1595157,515675789183380899,2021-12-12,26454982,Riana,An absolute gem the venue and the service exceeded all my expectations. I'll be back soon

1595157,528058101009750832,2021-12-29,82808066,Anna Luisa,What a magical place Thanks again for the amazing hospitality  comfortable beds and beautiful space.

1595157,533079905196635862,2022-01-05,224543454,Nathan,We had en enjoyable stay. However the steps to reach the cottage are quite difficult.
1595157,534587957006764079,2022-01-07,25779916,Cassidy,What a little gem. Thank you so much  Rosalind and Joel  for accommodating our last-minute request to stay in your place. We loved its seclusion  its comfy bed  the views of both the ocean and the mountain  and your thoughtful touches. It gave us the perfect opportunity to relax and unplug for a night  we would have stayed longer if we'd had the time. Thank you

1595157,558525199615472829,2022-02-09,27687002,Mignon,This was absolutely an amazing experience off-grid with a breathtaking view. We loved the dogs that came by time to time to say hello. Solar energy and self sufficient cottage with some short hiking trails with amazing views just with a 5 min walk in your own backyard. Hope to come back to this little hidden gem
1595157,567209315957664545,2022-02-21,365282373,Thomas,A great hideaway that feels close to nowhere. I enjoyed the stay  simple and rustic.
1595157,570823974070887416,2022-02-26,188281629,Hendri,Great place to stay if you want to be immersed in nature. The views are phenomenal and the area is so quiet. We had an awesome stay and hope to return here sometime in the future.
1595157,575100398791525628,2022-03-04,2493763,Michael,First things first Thanks to Tarisai for beeing there and making everything work. Now... What can I say Surely the best airbnb I've ever been in. A nature's lovers paradise. The stunning view  the beautiful designed shack  the whole premises are breathtaking. Read all the positive reviews and expect exactly that. The place is completely off grid  runs with solar power  fresh water from the mountain  LPG gas for cooking and heating. And with Joel you'll have a host  who knows about the history of the place and can tell it. Also go for a hike in the backyards. View gets better with each step. If you're looking for a bigger house for more people  check out the second place on the same premises. Super beautiful  too.
1595157,576538316517829343,2022-03-06,56806963,Kristi,What a magical place to stay at. Stunning position  magnificent views  friendly dogs  comfortable well-equipped kitchen. So close to the mountains and sea. We look forward to returning again.  Thank you so much for this fantastic experience.

1595157,589670372738487089,2022-03-24,55972647,Maggie,Beauty surrounds this solar-powered  mountain-water-fed gem. If you like charting your day by the course of the sun  candelabras  cooking in house  and friendly dogs  this is the place. Attentive hosts with good recommendations. Possibly the best jumping off point for Cape Peninsula exploring other than staying in the Park. Highly Recommended.
1595157,592593756043948695,2022-03-28,117796834,Ruben,Make sure your wake up for a sunrise  one of the best air b n bs i have stayed in Lovely place  easy check in

Tarisai is very helpful and was reachable at all times of day. The dogs are also adorable. We made quick friends. I would definitely choose to stay here again if I was in Simons Town.

1595157,792521191528632826,2022-12-29,45896231,Nicolaas,The hut is very original en personal not luxurious but special. Located in sort of wild garden with great view and a feeling of freedom. It is off the grid so no load shedding issues. Kitchen has enough to make a meal and the bed sleeps well. I will definitely go back.

Tarisai  the caretaker  was very hospitable. Perfectly located to explore Cape Point and Simons Town.

1595157,809942811060025349,2023-01-22,46933700,Dinh Truong,Rosalind place was a beautiful getaway on the road to Cape Point. The host was very welcoming and the people on the property were always very helpful. Would recommend it to anyone who appreciates nature.
1595157,815081254311391257,2023-01-29,36689264,Simon,Beautiful hideaway along the False Bay coast. The last property along the road and well hidden from all neighbours. Lovely trails around the mountain straight out the door. Very welcoming space Thanks for having us.

1595157,856336576807473284,2023-03-27,21731274,Simon,Rosalinds Property is just amazing. Located in the last stretch before Cape Point Nature Reserve you're sure to get some well deserved quietness from the ins and outs of city life. Rosalind and her husband took exceptional care of us. They provided everything we needed and more  while leaving us plenty of room for ourselves. Though we didn't have a car with us  most of the time we were able to get around the area without much trouble using uber. Some caution is definetly advised if you plan to do it in a similar way. The cottage itself is quiet a magical place  perfect for a romantic getaway. Due to the provision of power by solar energy loadshedding was not a problem and the internet worked perfectly. Though  you might not even want to use it as much once you're there. Don't miss out on a night on the adjacent patio since you'll be seeing a night sky difficult to beat. There's a high probability of catching a glimpse at the milky way and of more than a couple of shooting stars
1595157,857832923706351204,2023-03-29,68048172,Mike,Serenity and tranquility are what youll find here. Your cozy  private  modern cabin has a wonderful view of the bay  and it has all the amenities you could want to make you feel at home. I didnt even use electricity after dark  instead opting to read and relax by candlelight. Only a five minute drive from the entrance to Cape of Good Hope reserve  and less than 5 minutes from Simontown  it was a perfect place to stay if romantic isolation in beautiful surroundings is what you crave. Thanks also to Rosalind and company for an easy check in and relaxing experience. Her dogs were sweet

1595157,917241445776153158,2023-06-19,319010877,Nick,This is always a favourite place to go to find rest and quiet. It's set directly against the mountain  so nothing could be better. The hosts are exemplary too - they are great at communicating  make it really easy to get there  and their sustainable approach to living is an added bonus. Couldn't ask for more.

1595157,1048401189203520268,2023-12-17,38226788,Kelsy,Amazing spot to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. It was great to wake up and walk out your door with incredible sea views as well as mountain views  with walks up the mountain straight from the airbnb. The place was super cozy and had everything we needed and Joel's three dogs made the whole experience even better Can't wait to visit again
1595157,1063634478425596737,2024-01-07,434765681,Ibtishaam,Had a really pleasant stay in this beautiful cottage nestled in the mountains. So peaceful

1595157,1070940291589746672,2024-01-17,33042797,Rhea,We've had a lovely stay at the get away. The location is absolutely amazing and the house is great. Tarisai was very helpful and friendly with check-in. Two things to note First  there were three dogs constantly around the house and they tried to get in to the house too. Second  the wind can be very strong in the night  so even in summer it seems advisable to have some warm clothes for the evening and potentially ear plugs for the night because of the wind noise. That being said  we really enjoyed our two nights there and would wholeheartedly recommend.
1595157,1073799955975442904,2024-01-21,63857729,Leila,My Partner and I really enjoyed our stay and i highly recommend this accommodation I like to highlight the cleanliness and the amazing view specifically Thank you

If you're looking for a peaceful getaway on the coast this is it It feels like you're somewhere on the garden route surrounded by trees and a view of the ocean. Everything was clean and exactly as described  if not better than described.

1595157,1183206904090413474,2024-06-20,561460661,Daniel,We definitely enjoyed our stay at this airbnb. It is quite a different experience to common airbnbs as it is located in the nature. The views you will have are just amazing. When you lay in your bed you can hear the nature. Joel is a very friendly host and always makes sure you are doing great. We would definitely recommend this stay.

1996591,435354619,2019-04-10,139015822,Susan,We had a wonderful time in Cape Town and part of that was due to how great the Airbnb was. It is in a great location  has a wonderful view  and exceeded our expectations. We appreciated how prompt James was with his responses and the accommodations you made for us. Thank you so much for providing us such a great experience
1996591,436585828,2019-04-13,41272646,Molly,This was a spacious and clean apartment- we really enjoyed the wonderful views from the balconies. The location is a convenient distance from multiple attractions in Cape Town  and was situated in a popular area of the city. We would however  recommend using street smarts while out in the neighborhood and always use Ubertaxi  especially at night. For young women traveling alone  we felt safe within the apartment complex  which was a big priority for us
1996591,442418141,2019-04-23,216247369,Jiri,James was excelent  quick comunication  very kind and helpful always when I needed to solve something.

Plus  you will be greeted with the amazing view of Table Mountain when you draw the curtains at the balcony. James was also very responsive to my queries and both my check-in and check-out was seamless. Thanks for the amazing experience  James You truly live up to your Superhost status
1996591,515077128,2019-08-22,50278225,Gabriela,Weve loved the experience at James place The view is stunning The Place is very clean  beautiful  has all the facilities. We have absolutly nothing to complain The security and the service on the building are perfect too. Will recomend for sure

1595205,10307732,2014-02-12,1011835,Sebastien,My wife and I really enjoyed staying at Louise's flat  which is located in the heart of Kalk Bay  right across from the train station and within minutes of many cafes and restaurants. The flat itself is spacious  functional and tastefully decorated. Louise was a fantastic host - responsive  available and welcoming. Highly recommended.
1595205,10564695,2014-02-25,10407536,David,100... Thank you very much
1595205,20207679,2014-09-25,18529808,Jason,Staying in Whalehaven during our visit to Cape Town was an amazing experience. The apartment was well positioned to allow us to see and tour Kalk Bay and its surrounds as well as to access transportation to head into the city. The rooms were spacious and well looked after  the decor was exquisite and matched the areas incredibly and our hosts were more than gracious when tending to our miscellaneous needs.
1595205,21677466,2014-10-21,12179125,Paul,This was my second stay at Louise's beautiful apartment in Kalk Bay and its as perfect as ever for a relaxing week for lovers of seafood and picture perfect scenery. Thanks again and I'll be back soon.
1595205,32076575,2015-05-13,12656586,Sandrine,Louise's apartment is true to pictures  even better I would say. It was amazing to wake up everyday with this gorgeous seaview. The apartment has everything you need for a self-cattering accommodation  all furnishing and equipment are of quality. Also  it is very well located  plenty of cafe and restaurants in the street  and quaint little shops. The communication all along was smooth and easy. We had a great stay in Louise's apartment  I hope we can come back soon.
1595205,60118851,2016-01-19,46630696,Caroline,We have just returned from spending a week at Whalehaven  and have to say it was the best accommodation to have chosen. The location could not have been better  and with the bedrooms facing  the mountains it was very peaceful at night  and you wake up and have breakfast looking out to sea.  The apartment has everything you need and you feel very secure. Louise came over to say hello and check all was well  and when we couldn't work the TV someone came straight over to show us how it all worked.  Will definitely be returning and staying longer

The apartment is beautifully renovated and tastefully and thoughtfully decorated  is light  bright and airy with huge sliding windows that open to an expansive view of the ocean on the other side of the road and is spotless  secure and completely comfortable - it  offered everything necessary for a short or long stay. Louise was a friendly  helpful  accessible and responsive host. She generously welcomed us with a  bottle of wine and  just before our departure  she popped in to say goodbye. We often go to Kalk Bay  which we love  but staying here added a wonderful new dimension to our experience of the area. We highly recommend this accommodation.

1595205,635657554,2020-07-07,37655202,Natasha,We spent a magical week in the flat with our 11 month old son. Everything we needed was provided for so it felt like a real holiday break. The flat has great self catering facilities and there are lots of places to buy meals. Our activities were limited because of COVID lockdown but the flat itself is a beautiful space to be in. The incredible view and position in the heart of Kalk Bay immerses one in the quaint village life with access to breathtaking dawn vistas over the ocean from the comfort of the living room.

A beautiful  open  airy and thoughtfully kitted out spot to have a coffee and croissant in the morning before you cross the road  dip in the tidal pool and wander about the town  or a glass of wine in front of the fireplace in the evening after a day on the beach or spent sightseeing. Louise and her husband are wonderful and gracious hosts and I couldn't recommend their place highly enough.
1595205,430870720460594232,2021-08-17,65875442,Marina,Dont think twice - book Louises place. It is just perfect. With its European feel  the unspoilt view over False Bay and the vibey feel of Kalk Bay  its just the place to book if you want to go on the coastal walk to Muizenberg or browse the many quiant shops in Kalk Bay.

1595205,581649315724535507,2022-03-13,115917670,Clare,A view to die for. This is a fantastic flat. The large windows slide fully open.  The outlook is off the scale fantastic  especially for a lover of funky Kalk Bay. You feel part of the action  but with the bedrooms on the back you still get a good nights sleep.  We felt safe. The little balcony at the back was lovely too.  We look forward to our next visit.

The house is on the main road  so it is relatively noisy from the traffic when the window is open. But even that was perfectly fine for us  especially since the bedrooms are on the other side of the flat and there was complete silence. We enjoyed the apartment and the hospitality of Louise and Kalk Bay very much and can only recommend the apartment and the place.
1595205,783871657197343290,2022-12-17,59032056,Hennelie,We had a great stay..clean  everything you need..walking to shops a bonus. Lovely view of Kalkbay. modern apartment.
1595205,838919126903614714,2023-03-03,7441210,Franco,We spent a couple of days at Louise's place at it has been all very cosy and nice. The apartment seems a little smaller than in the pictures but the view from the living room is truly astonishing.
1595205,850572620472877534,2023-03-19,2815507,Anelle,Lovely space with great views. Everything as described and Louise was very responsive and helpful
1595205,852789017342740896,2023-03-22,16088120,Dudley,It is a great location and the recent remodel makes the property like new. There are many fantastic restaurants within 1-5 minutes walk and the ocean views are stunning. Very nice place and my wife and I loved it and would recommend it highly to anyone. Louise was a great host and helped make our stay a great experience.
1595205,855633900173679634,2023-03-26,49074612,Bronwynne,Beautiful apartment with breathtaking views  we loved every minute of it
1595205,887523349136287417,2023-05-09,406915435,James,Dont stay stay here if you need electricity for remote work  a hot shower  or medical reasons.
1595205,920884250416676482,2023-06-24,73217498,Margaret,Very comfortable flat with wonderful views of False Bay.  Local restaurants were very enjoyed  especially the Salt and Harbour House. Louise and her husband accommodated our requests and were super helpful when I was feeling ill.  The wood stove kept the winter chill at bay.  I would stay again and highly recommend.
1595205,928115354999182906,2023-07-04,41970237,Nicky,Our fifth stay in this wonderful apartment. Considered  comfortable interior and a perfect location. We will be back
1595205,993303975233559370,2023-10-02,178608842,Matthew,I spent two extremely cold weeks at Whalehaven  but the wood stove worked great and made it bearable.  Excellent views of False Bay and Kalk Bay Harbor  and a very busy street scene below. Kitchen is large and well appointed although I never cooked once and only made coffee.  Many very good restaurants nearby and a functional train to get to Muizenburg or Fish Hoek if you like. There is definitely quite a bit of noise from the Main Road  but with the windows closed  it's definitely bearable.  Nights are peaceful and the bed was comfortable and there was plenty of storage.  You can open the doors to the back porch from the master bedroom and sit at the table and have your coffee in the morning or a sundowner in the evening.   There was quite a bit of rain when I was there and I could hear the frogs on the mountain while in bed and the calls from the local mosque at dusk  which all seemed kind of magical.  Definitely  recommend.
1595205,1103441540117119384,2024-03-02,432315717,Deborah,Absolutely fantastic apartment with views to die for. Very homely feel. We felt much safer than we expected to. The people in the area are so friendly. Fab restaurants nearby. Dont miss Bobs coffee shop and Satori for food. We will definitely visit this apartment again. Outstanding. And Louise is a great host. Very quick to respond.
1595205,1110030242271282275,2024-03-11,119801330,Rob,Locatie is super  direct aan de boulevard  alles beloopbaar. uitzicht op de basis  zelfs dolfijnen gesport. Staat ook een kijker in de kamer zodat je ver op ze kunt kijken.
1595205,1124463538146714182,2024-03-31,144222508,Mari,Louises place is impeccable. Well designed and comfortable. Right in the middle of the quirkiness of Kalk Bay. We were there on Easter weekend and had quite a few engagements. Parking was a little difficult  but we always managed within a block or two. Last time I felt this vibe was in Venice. Here the view was just better You make me proud to be a South African  Louise
1595205,1136149046005232659,2024-04-16,34061222,Jan,Wonderful place with gorgeous views Very nice responsive host.
1595205,1150552655482480383,2024-05-06,72637420,Ingrid,Walhaven is serene and beautiful in the heart of Kalk Bay. The views are magical. The music wafting up from the street musicians last night as the sun set was the cherry on the cake. The bedrooms are at the back of the apartment with a view to the mountain and there is a lovely porch infront of them that catches the morning sun. The best Airbnb I have stayed in to date and I hope to stay there again in future. Ingrid
1996591,715829489,2020-12-16,26408274,Philip,Modern  well-appointed apartment with stunning balcony views in high rise block in convenient town centre location.

1616731,9178662,2013-12-11,8852124,Meryl,I cannot say enough wonderful things about Nicky and Bryan and their spectacular apartment with breathtaking views.  The apt is immaculate and beautifully decorated  clean  organized  and luxurious.  The views will spoil you  unless of course Nicky and Bryan get to you first.  Fresh roses greeted me on the dining room table  and housekeeping greeted me twice a week with laundry service to boot  Seriously  Nicky and Bryan are the most warm  generous  fabulous hosts and will be lifelong friends.  I was lucky to have found this gem  and won the lottery on meeting them.  Cheers

From start to finish we were made to feel very welcome. Our host Linda was very quick with communication and we were met by her lovely staff who made our stay very pleasant. No request was a problem. The house was kept very clean and tidy for us which we much appreciated  the villa is situated in the most central area  which makes visiting all the must see places so easy. We had a fabulous time and would have no hesitation in recommending Taronga Villa to anyone. We requested late check out re late flights and was granted that no problem. We would again like to thank all at Taronga Villa.

Es gibt jetzt eine effektive Verdunklung im Schlafzimmer  ein neues Bett und eine neue Aufteilung der Sitzecke. Whrend unseres Aufenthaltes wurde der Khlschrank gegen ein neues  absolut leises Modell ausgetauscht. Zudem kamen zwei Sonnensthle  die die Nutzung des oberen Balkons perfekt machen. Die Lage der Wohnung ist einzigartig. Man kann von hier fast jeden Punkt zu Fu erreichen  was insbesondere durch die verstrkten Sicherheitsmanahmen in der Stadt ein Vergngen ist. Auch die Sicherheit innerhalb des Gebudes ist perfekt. James ist ein perfekter Gastgeber. Wir hatten wunderschne Wochen- und kommen bald wieder

2000857,10229200,2014-02-08,9608747,Stephan,Amazing place  beautiful interior  great location Definitely recommended.
2000857,12681922,2014-05-08,1547903,Tijana,We spent three months in Cape Town and it really felt like home  thanks to Louise  her lovely apartment and her staff. She is a wonderful person  very pleasant  smart and stylish. The whole time we felt like someone is taking care of us  from the lunch that waited for us in the fridge when we arrived much appreciated after a long flight to warm blankets when it was raining  useful advices when we needed help and many other things.  The apartment itself is just perfect  it is functional and simply beautiful  with wonderful view on the ocean and the sunsets. It was a real home for us.
2000857,16582657,2014-07-29,18070842,Tapfuma,Great Place to stay in the mother city. Uber Luxe is exactly like it looks in the pictures  and Louise does a superb job making sure you're well taken care of. The only issue I had was trying to get out of bed in the downstairs room...The bedding feels amazing You want to just curl up and stay in bed all day
2000857,22802737,2014-11-15,22919436,Peter,We truly enjoyed our time at Bantry Bay. The apartment was as advertised and our greeting by Elizabeth was both friendly and helpful. We did struggle with certain aspects of our stay  in regards to how to operate various household devices television  lights and air conditioner however when we contacted Louise with our questions her responses were prompt and helpful. We did wish that this information  as well as recommendations for restaurants  had been provided in the apartment as that would have made our stay smoother.
2000857,25003240,2015-01-05,3522740,Holly,What can I say I cant imagine how any stay will be able to top this one Not only was this apartment an extremely inspiring space to live in but meeting Louise was such a pleasure. It was such a privilege to chat to her and obtain an insight into her amazing world Working in the design field myself  Ive never come across someone with such talent- Louises attention to detail is impeccable which makes for the PERFECT home away from home. The likes of Ralph Lauren or Tom Form would be lucky to stay here  In terms of our stay  the location couldnt be better- Bantry Bay is the place to be The apartment is in arms reach to the ocean and in walking distance to restaurants such as the delectable Koi Restaurant. Its convenient to the Centre of Town and the renowned Camps Bay. We stayed very comfortably as a family of four and very much enjoyed all of the luxury comforts provided  especially the beautiful spa bath upstairs The apartment is well equipped for those who choose to cook and Louise generously left us lunch as well as plenty of other supplies. Cant wait to stay again
2000857,42424507,2015-08-13,3328081,Erika,Louise was absolutely wonderful and made me feel very at home She really went the extra mile

2000857,63866207,2016-02-28,14648243,Sally,The apartment was beautiful and stylish exactly as described but we expected nothing less as we had stayed in Louise's other apartment previously. Nothing was too much trouble for Louise who gave us lots of tips as to where to go and eat.
2000857,65071222,2016-03-10,8212724,Maxim,Louise was really great. She welcomed us upon arrival. All organizational things went really smooth. She is a local and knows Cape Town perfectly well. Her taste for the apartment interior is spectacular. Thanks again  Louise We really felt at home
2000857,66160944,2016-03-20,2669919,Jon,The Apartment in Sea Point was fabulous. Louise was a charming  gracious hostess. After our 15 hour all night flight she was kind enough to let us check in early. Also her lovely gift of fruit basket  food was well appreciated. The abode is well appointed and is a great base to operate from to see all the local sights. The Sea Point area has everything one needs to have a relaxing  restful holiday. Will be back in the spring Highly recommend this apartment for everyone.....
2000857,121422842,2016-12-16,90579428,Robyn,Louise was absolutely brilliant. And also hilarious Her apartment was decorated to such a high standard and it really was a pleasure coming home after a long day at the beach. Louise also kindly offered to send a cleaner mid week in case we needed her. Louise thought ahead and we had a nice bag of crossiants and milk ready for our breakfast. All in all I was hugely impressed. I would highly recommend this property to friends.
2000857,125084807,2017-01-03,15715632,Magiel,Great location  everything about this place is stunning  exceeded all our expectations  highly recommended.

2000857,243521152,2018-03-16,17357175,Jumana,Wonderful apartment in one of the best locations of Cape Town. If you look for a nice place to stay close to Camps Bay and Cliffton Beach  this is the place to be. Louise is a perfect host  always approachable and taking care of things e.g. we did not have enough wine glasses  she took care right away. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Louise also had great advice on shopping and dining. Our luggage was stowed in the hotel next door before we left Cape Town  so very comfortable and easy for us. Thanks
2000857,245675921,2018-03-23,17672383,Razan,Louis has given the airbnb super host a new meaning She has totally raised the benchmark. Our experience was superb  I dont think we could have stayed at any 5 star hotel that could have come close to offering this charm and given us our privacy at the same time. Shes a designer herself and it was very obvious from all the elegant yet cozy touches through out the duplex apartment. The area was central yet away from the traffic and had all devices you would need right around the corner. In conclusion  we highly recommend staying here
2000857,249512046,2018-04-02,109192002,Naeema,We had a lovely stay in Louises apartment. The apartment is very comfortable and designed beautifully. It is centrally located near the beachfront and close to shops and restaurants. Louise was excellent at responding to communications and very kind.

2000857,273517162,2018-06-06,15476512,Kevin,The best decision I made was booking Louise's apartment. She was so helpful and communication with her was so easy.  Her apartment is located within a five minute walk to excellent bars  restaurants.   I cannot say enough good things about Louise.  Trust me you will not be disappointed if you book this place.
2000857,286928027,2018-07-07,62749027,Andrea,This is a cozy  private apartment - very upmarket and stylish.  Perfect for a couple who need somewhere to come back to after a busy day.  Lots of extras providedcharming host and you will enjoy the location along with great security.  Perfect for the city stay and busy trips.
2000857,296699522,2018-07-26,51256221,Charlie,Great place  good location and Louise was always on hand if we needed anything.

2000857,348752889,2018-11-15,64390590,Flora,First of all  Louise arranged a pick-up and drop-off for us and answered many questions. Very careful and caring. Secondly  my friends and I love her room style  and the details inside are very hard. For example  various seasoning bottles including chili sauce  Chinese style dishes  aromas engraved with her name  comfortable bedding  photos of her favorite celebrities  etc. Finally  I hope that louise will be happy and have time to travel to China
2000857,353915215,2018-11-30,190799512,Mitch,Wonderful value  clean home in a great area. You do not find better than this.
2000857,356122460,2018-12-07,2324410,Yvonne,Louise is a wonderful host and the place is exactly as described  we were able to walk everywhere easily and made our stay in Cape Town a special experience. Louise was extremely accommodating to us and we felt very fortunate to have had her as our host for my first trip in South Africa. Thank you Louise  hope to see you again soon.
2000857,362832105,2018-12-27,205784771,Angelo,Apartment very well located  charming  clean and comfortable.  For sure will be my choice for the next trip to Cape Town. very thoughtful and extremely polite host. I recommend everyone who appreciates very good taste and hospitality.
2000857,400904648,2019-01-13,22341408,Fergus,Despite not being able to meet us on arrival  Louise did a great job helping us with everything that we needed. The apartment is very clean and well decorated and in a great location just a short walk from the beach. We would definitely love to stay again
2000857,412693664,2019-02-16,68168419,,Louise is a very friendly and elegant lady. The choice of her house was a blessing on the trip. Her suite is very stylish and cozy. The location is convenient and safe. We got lots of help from her and always respond promptly. If you travel here  Louise s house would be the best option.
2000857,426160534,2019-03-20,23526131,Marya,We had a great stay in Louise s place. It is beautifully decorated and well equipped.
2000857,431531296,2019-04-01,8882478,Douglas,The unit is a gem.  Louise personal decorating touches are a special treat.  Louise was extremely accommodating and helpful.  We could not have been happier with our stay.  The location was perfect for our family 12 block from beach board walk  the property borders Sea Point and its commercial district  and is 1 block from Sea Point Tennis  etc.  Of course  Cape Town and the Western Cape are magnificent with a profound beauty  history and culture that is ever evolving.
2000857,434617873,2019-04-08,15630882,Fauzi,Was staying 3 nights at Louise loft. Divine intervention to book at her place. Fortunate and no regret as i was contemplating between 5 star hotel and hers. Situated right smacked below the Lion's head at posh area between Sea Point and Camps Bay. Excellent location and secured. Close to restaurants  beach just 2 minutes walk  pharmacy and groceries just few minutes walk too. Louise was meticulous in her deco  Armani inspired  luxury touch  tastefully. Everything are design to be grandeur and welcoming. Bed was super comfy  fast internet  nespresso machine is a plus  netflix was awesome  kitchen is fully equipped and list goes further... Great recommendation of restaurants. We went to Lily's on her recommendation for breakfast and the egg benedict over Norwegian cured salmon was to die for.. Her info sharing over documents prepared was superb  if you want to eat  go where the locals are and it is all inside the the guide. You asked 1 question  she answered and gave you other info. Just like an answering machine.. - Grand star for that. The only regret is for not having enough time to enjoy her loft... lazing on couch  sipping a coffee while checking my email.. what else.. Just book and experience it yourself.. Thanks Louise  definitely yours is the best airbnb experience thus far... Will return..
2000857,438258823,2019-04-16,29372305,Geoff,Place is as described. It met all the needs of my family of 5.
2000857,445849575,2019-04-30,159732642,Devon,Great location  Great host  and such a modern gem in Bantry Bay. Will pick one of Louises places for our future holidays for sure
2000857,508081386,2019-08-12,277947365,Nelan,The apartment was an absolute pleasure.
2000857,537911734,2019-09-29,104638534,Tim,Beautiful home
2000857,556716620,2019-10-30,9123184,David,Great place.
2000857,566370017,2019-11-19,239711299,Luke,This is not an apartment but rather a cluttered showroom of Louises brands products including a mannequin with leisure wear and an excess of about 18 pieces of furniture from her own brand. All for sale and a sign clearly stating that this is a showroom not to mention business cards placed strategically all over. Ive never complained about a place Ive stayed before and my girlfriend and I own two homes  which are both on Airbnb. I dont know how she has an Airbnb plus status.. other than an acceptance rating for people who stay there for a night or two and dont really care. Im still struggling to get refunded because she is fighting this. We didnt spend a single night in this apartment and Louise seems to think she isnt in the wrong. This is our holiday and this has been the biggest nightmare. The pictures she has posted are missing about 18 pieces of furniture and the fact that there isnt any packing space and absolutely no space in this cluttered showroom Id love to add photos but there isnt that option.
2000857,583149547,2019-12-28,4600165,Lisa,Absolutely perfect location between Sea Point and CliftonCamps Bay. We had a fabulous time walking everywhere
2000857,609066313,2020-02-22,61169167,Kim,Louise goes above and beyond in her hospitality and the apartment was absolutely stunning  yet comfortable to stay in as well. Right off the pages of the finest interior design magazine. It will not disappoint. We had 5 in our party and it was the most enjoyable place to stay for a holiday. Would also be perfect for a romantic get away for two Well stocked with anything you could want or need and so many extras. The apartment was spotless and in such a perfect location...A 30 second walk to the beach  walking distance to a grocery store  restaurants and  yet you felt privately secluded in the apartment. We will definitely be back Thank you beautiful Louise You made our first trip to South Africa  most memorable and lovely.
2000857,615582126,2020-03-08,336313233,Petra,Very beautiful place and friendly host.
2000857,625042394,2020-05-17,82426673,Caissa,Louise is an incredibly organized host and the apartment if nothing but impeccable. The location is superb and it truly felt like a home away from home with the elegance of what a holiday should feel like.
2000857,628454467,2020-06-08,342117910,Eugene,Louise is by far the best host  very welcoming and her assistance was felt even from a distance. The interior space is well thought out and the glass encased instructions on how to operate the tv  wifi password and  water taps are magical. The soundcast really added the clearest vibrations making the background acoustics to the lounge sensational. The lighting in the lounge is very calculated and i loved how the switches give you control to set the mood you want. The extra blankets and warm silk bedding really are a kick at winter times. The set up upstairs is just as a marvel as downstairs with the same control on lighting. The upstairs is a very intimate setting for a couple as the tv set up  the candles around the bath tub and the bath tub controls scream a romantic flair alongside with his and hers bathroom sinks. The sounds of the ocean can be heard from the window next to the upstairs bed and this really adds to the ambience of the space. What a euphoric EXPERIENCE 
2000857,629527748,2020-06-14,342181228,Ian,Exquisitely decorated space but that's where it ends

The host even left little snacks around which was not necessary I found this so thoughtful. The best part of my stay was meeting my host and the introduction she gave us to the place.

1643042,613530038,2020-03-02,64588316,Ghis,Beautiful loft situated in Salt Rivers. 10 minutes away from Cape Town hotspots with the vibe of a developing district of the city. Dencel is a great host on top of that. 5 stars

1643042,658901165,2020-08-31,216842735,Tina,Super thoughtful decorations in an industrial style studio apartment  close to trendy Woodstock and Obz. A bit chilly during winter  but the heateraircon solved it easily albeit requiring some navigation to get there. High-end kitchen utilities and intuitive storage thereof. Best of all was the huge bed and quality bedding. There were some pleasant signs of an active neighbourhood during the weekend  but not loud or disruptive. Would easily come back for another stay

The apartment upstairs has young children  so this property is best booked if you will be out exploring the nearby market and stores. Whilst parking is safe and the building secure  one cant walk freely at night time however e-hailing services are easily available.

1643042,846976606593223508,2023-03-14,29251985,Jonathan,So nicely decorated  very comfortable even for longer stays  however rolling power and wifi outages are common in that part of the city not a host problem.

1643042,1065814169365228546,2024-01-10,158914487,Timothy,The place was as described  had load shedding on our final day  there was no backup in the apartment but the apartment building had some power. I feel a little more attention can be given to cleaning the couch and the windows. Some of the windows didnt have shutters of curtains. So it gets blight pretty early in the apartment this summer
1643042,1071610830803690143,2024-01-18,79983708,Jorn,Thank you so much Dencel I very much enjoyed the spacious loft Everything was perfect for what I needed. Great that I could park the car inside on a bigger spot. Just the Internet was a bit slow at times. Also  I was lucky that I stayed over the school holidays so overall it was mostly quite. Overall good value for money. Best regards  Jorn
1643042,1087569613395326658,2024-02-09,434425095,Isaiah,Dencel and Shereleen were excellent hosts. They went above and beyond to make sure my stay went well. Would definitely book this place again

1643095,29400793,2015-04-07,13159197,Joyce  David,We enjoyed our stay at the Junior Suite. Though we never met the owner we were nicely welcomed by the property manager Laura. The housekeeper  Ellen  was great and takes excellent care of the guesthouse. It was a welcome reprieve to stay outside of Cape Town in this beach community. We enjoyed watching the kite surfers and walking the beach  though it's important to note that the building is not on the beach. The guesthouse has a cool vibe with high quality amenities.  We used the well appointed kitchen for only coffee and breakfast since we were otherwise too busy exploring and eating in the many wonderful area restaurants.  Our suite had two balconies  comfortable beds and linens and everything we needed for our stay.
1644384,25006141,2015-01-05,20389255,Luizet,We had a lovely stay at Bruce and Elmarie's house. There was a detailed information pack that was waiting for us when we arrived  which we referred to many times. The house was beautiful  as depicted in the photos and my family really felt at home.
1644384,366684561,2019-01-03,101249163,Lais,Casa extremamente aconchegante e limpa Atendeu todas nossas expectativas. Gostamos muito da estadia  aproveitamos as comodidades da casa piscina  churrasqueira  varanda. Esperamos poder voltar em brave

1653819,9814712,2014-01-12,1770311,Etienne,My wife and I had a great time in Cape Town thanks to Connell and his warm welcome. The flat is of a good size  clean  private  and the beds were quite comfortable. Exceptional location to explore the interesting parts of the city  with many great restaurants and entertainment venues nearby. Connell was more than willing to provide advice and suggestions for things to do and places to see as he clearly loves his home city Will come back next time we are in Cape Town

Loved staying here And the kitchen is fully equipped  so nice if you like eating in.
2000857,485259425722451836,2021-10-31,261124623,Oleksandra,Perfect

2000857,575862123546554128,2022-03-05,310432836,Chip,We rented this apartment for four weeks and from start to finish this was an absolutely great experience.  My initial conversations with Louise were helpful  pro-active  lively and even fun.  Her communication style was excellent and particularly since this was going to be an apartment primarily for my older mother traveling to South Africa for the first time  Louise totally put my mind at ease about the set-up  location  safetysecurity  the assistance of her staff  etc  etc.   Because we were several people traveling from different continents we had to adjust the dates slightly on both ends.  That was met with absolute flexibility on her part.   Upon arrival Louise was there to welcome us with her team and the whole thing could not have been more seamless.  That stayed consistent throughout out our trip if anything came up that we required.  As we primarily needed to be close to Clifton  Camps Bay  Sea Point and Green Point the location is PERFECT  it's just far enough into Bantry Bay to make it feel very calm  safe and secure but with the amenities of Sea Point  just a 5 minute walk away cleaners  groceries  cute shops and restaurants.  One of the unexpected  highlights was being so close to Saunders Rock Beach where a morning congregation of people go for a cold-water plungeswim in the tidal pools there.   That area of coastal Bantry BaySea Point which is almost like a little enclave also felt very safe with tons of people out for walks  runs  swims at all time of day.  The apartment itself was perfect for us - each level is quite independent from the other yet totally integrated and cohesive.   It's great for two couples traveling together  a multi-generational set-up with parents and kids not young ones due to the staircase  or two singles who each want their own independence and space.  Each area had its own bed  sitting area  and bathroom.  There were oodles of shelves and storageclosets so unpacking was  a dream.  It was very bright and airy and although I wouldn't say it is officially sea-view it does have a partial view of the sea from one of the upstairs windows which was a lovely way to wake up each day.  It also felt very secure particularly with an security access point for the President Hotel literally steps away from the entrance who also keep an eye on things.  There is really not a single thing I could suggest on how this experience could have been better.  There is a certain amount of bird noise - particularly gulls - but we found that wonderful and charming and totally in keeping with location.  We will definitely plan returning next year and renting this flat again.  Thank you  Louise
1653819,9913221,2014-01-19,9103042,Madelon,Connell was very kind to receive us late  recommend some things and allow us to leave our bags while we explored the area the next day. A lovely start to our vacation
1653819,10101551,2014-01-31,9700169,Jens,This Appartment ist very centrally located. From Greenmarket it is just a few steps to anywhere in the city. The sightseeing busses leave just around the corner. The flat is clean and Connell looks after you very well for  fresh clean sheets and towels. The kitchen contains everything you need to whip up a small storm. The house itself has a very beautiful and distinct fassade reminds you of 1920's. You will enjoy it.
1653819,10260460,2014-02-10,447097,Stephanie,Connell est un hte exceptionnel et trs flexible. Malgr des problmes avec mes vols ariens il fut trs accommodant tant au niveau du transport qu'autour des termes concernant l'appartement. L'appartement est situ  un endroit magnifique et l'accs  toutes les attractions sont accessibles  la marche. Je recommande  100 cet appartement de Cape Town. J'y retournerai  mon prochain sjour sans hsiter. Merci Connell
1653819,10434399,2014-02-18,741164,Alejandro,Connell is extremely friendly and great host  The apartment was extremely clean and well organized.  The locations is spectacular and our overall experience was awesome  Would stay there again if in Cape Town.
1653819,10814479,2014-03-09,1252978,Andrea,We had a fantastic stay in Market House  it is in a wonderfully vibey area with great restaurants and the city at your feet It was ideal for us as we did not hire a car and being so close to city buses and walking distance to main attractions made it a breeze to explore the city.
1653819,10893076,2014-03-11,7206961,Timothy,This is a great place in the heart of downtown. We were met at 9 pm at the door by Connell. The apartment is roomy and secure - safe parking for two days was 100 yards away and cost a total of 10 -- right in front would have been ok too I suspect.  Above all  you can't beat the location or  reception. We will do it again next year. Tim
1653819,11169270,2014-03-24,4043167,William,Connell Davids is a kind man. He delivered what he promised  the apartment is as described  and the location is outstanding right in the middle of Cape Town. The apartment's balcony overlook Green Market Square was an added benefit. We felt secure and comfortable and if we had any questions  he was accessible and responsive.  We recommend Connell and his apartment.
1653819,11339516,2014-03-30,12117494,Julian,Great location Lovely host  stayed in communication with us - very easy to deal with. Clean  compact apartment which has everything you might need Great views and we would stay again.
1653819,11638253,2014-04-10,2032382,Tait,We had an excellent stay in Connell's flat on Green Market Square.  The accommodation is quite nice - we particularly enjoyed the large  fully equipped kitchen and the views of the market from the balcony.  The location of the flat is perfectly situated near Long Street restaurants  bars  shopping  and museums.  The trainbus station is a quick walk away  and it is easy to catch a private taxi or walk to other areas of the city.  Connell was a lovely host who welcomed us and bid us farewell  offering great advice about the city and general kindness that was above and beyond what we expected.  Thanks so much  Connell  We hope to visit again
1653819,12236254,2014-04-27,3932351,Bing,We had challenges with finding the apartment - Connell was patient in helping us find it. We arrived late - he patiently waited for us and provided us with lots of helpful information about the location  the city  etc. The location was perfect as was the apartment. Thanks Connell

1653819,13475626,2014-05-28,14152935,Blaine,The host Connell was great  he was there when we arrived and gave us a tour of the apt. The apt was as the listing said. Was in a great location overlooking Greenmarket Square. The apt was plenty of space  2 beds  kitchen  bathroom and balcony. Also has an elevator and doorman. Overall  was a great and easy experience  great apt  would definitely recommend it if you're staying in Cape Town. Was 1 block away from Long street and generally easy to get out and about from this location
1653819,13577437,2014-05-31,15151376,Benjamin,Connell was very accommodating  greeting us late at night with a warm welcome. The space is well-kept and in a fantastic location. I was very happy and lucky to experience Cape Town from such a wonderful location.
1653819,14165207,2014-06-13,15050872,Justin,Connell was a very pleasant gentleman that we were fortunate to meet.  He was there to receive us and sent us off.  I only wish that I had more time in Cape Town and stayed more nights.  My two nights short stay was jammed packed with all the exciting tour sites.  I will definitely go back and stay with Connell again.  Flat was awesome  it is a historic site itself.  It is very close to kong street where all the restaurants and shops are.  I enjoyed the view and the market that it offers.  Thanks again for the lovely experience.
1653819,14361629,2014-06-17,8969403,Pierre,It doesn't get any more central than this We loved being able to walk everywhere in the City Bowl and being able to look out on one of Cape Town's most beautiful art deco buildings in historic Greenmarket Square. The apartment was furnished with everything we need  from extra towels and blankets to a heater and a water filter in the fridge. Connell was an extremely accommodating host who was courteous enough to welcome us to the apartment and see us off again on our last day. We really loved our stay in Market House
1653819,14488807,2014-06-20,1381293,Woodward,Great location Great host Connell went out of his way to make me feel welcome and to make sure I had a great visit to Cape Town. Will definitely be back soon and I will definitely stay here.
1653819,15616492,2014-07-13,11236566,Judith,Great experience with Connell. He picked us up at the airport for a small fee and delivered us to the flats door. Even checked up on us after a particularly cold nite. The flat was right in the heart of the city and convenient to everything. Cape town is beautiful and we really enjoyed our stay.
1653819,16659557,2014-07-31,16020331,Alex,Connell was a great host. He met us promptly when we checked in and showed us the ins and outs of the apartment. The place was perfect for our needs -- located in Green Market Square  right in the center of town. There are tons of great cafes  vendors  and restaurants located within 5 minutes of the building. The apartment has a nice little balcony with a great view over the Square and my girlfriend and I enjoyed sitting out there on nice evenings. Connell met us again when we checked out to help us lock up and see how we enjoyed our stay. Overall we had a fantastic experience.
1653819,16822559,2014-08-03,735674,Tara,It was perfect Location  comfort  everything We would stay again for sure.
1653819,17062105,2014-08-06,17850761,Alex,Market House is in a great location. Everything you need is within a 5-minute walk. Long Street and Bo-Kaap is just a few blocks away. The flat is clean  tastefully decorated and quiet during sleeping hours. There's a washer and dryer  and internet connectivity was very good. However  the best feature was the host. We loved talking to Connell and should have allocated more time just for that
1653819,17361605,2014-08-11,5297142,Willem,What a nice place in the middle of the city We loved staying there  nice and cheap public parking lot accross the market. Had a great welkom by Connell  who helped us plan our trips. Just make sure you make reservations to robben island several days on beforehand and check for the  opening of the cable cart to table mountain in winter. Despite missing these  we had a great time in the city and surroundings Thanks Connell
1653819,17823931,2014-08-18,396159,Robyn,Connell was a wonderful host  from the moment he met us at the airport in Cape Town to him waving us off on our next adventure. The apartment was secure and just as depicted  clean and well situated for markets  museums  hop on hop off buses and restaurants and cafes. Perfect. Could not have been more central. Comfortable beds. Wonderful market on the doorstep. Thank you Connell. Next time we are in Cape Town we would like to stay again.
1653819,18489317,2014-08-27,19349899,Paul,This flat is in a fantastic central location that's a great jumping off point for exploring Cape Town and the environs.  It's exactly as displayed in the pictures and has good security.  Connell was a terrific host  greeting me upon arrival and keeping in touch during my stay to make sure no issues came up.  I will absolutely be back
1653819,19092003,2014-09-06,20203401,Ntando,I had such a wonderful time in Cape Town It was such a pleasure to be close to where I needed to go. Connell was a great host and gave me the privacy I wanted. Thank you once again  I will contact you when I am in South Africa again.
1653819,20225557,2014-09-26,15353354,Kerry,Connell was good enough to pick us up at the airport .... much appreciated by us He was a great tour guide on the way in. We arrived at his charming apartment and we very happy to learn that there was wifi The apartment location is awesome as it is just off Long Street and right in the middle of the city. You are a two minute walk to the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus a great way to get oriented in the city. Groceries and restaurants are easy from the apartment and having the Green Market Square market right there really added flavor to the whole experience We loved Cape Town and the apartment
1653819,20896629,2014-10-07,11072971,Email Hidden By Airbnb,Connell is a fantastic host and well recommended. He met me at the airport and took me to the apartment small extra charge. The apartment was spotless and exactly as described. Everything was there  towels  crockery  cutlery and even some coffee Location was ideal  right in the centre of the old town. 100m to the tourist hop-on hop-off tour bus office. Security guard on the main entrance 24 hoursday so felt very safe. Definitiely recommend Excellent
1653819,21083804,2014-10-11,20781258,Gudrun,I could not have chosen a better place for our stay. Connell was the perfect host. The flat was clean  we had comfortable and warm beds - nothing was lacking. We never had to cook meals for ourselves as there are so many restaurants on Greenmarket Square to choose from. The bus stop for the Hop On - Hop Off bus was just down the road which saved a lot of time and taxicab money. We were able to walk to many places in the city like St George's Cathedral  Company Gardens  Bo-Dorp  Castle etc. The flat is very central and convenient. We will most definitely recommend Flat 402 and will make use of it again if in Cape Town. We felt safe and secure throughout our stay. Only regret we had was - we should have booked at least one more night. Thank you Connell for collecting us from the bus and taking us back there again Your friendliness and helpfulness was much appreciated.
1653819,21470492,2014-10-18,9392602,Patrick,Great flat great location great host.
1653819,22578120,2014-11-10,1820527,Matthew,Great place within walking distance to many great sites. Abit of confusion on arrival from the airport but it was all sorted. Connell was helpful to give tips about the city and even graciously gave us a lift on our check out. We loved it.
1653819,23464396,2014-12-01,1906267,Erin,The experience was exactly what we expected. It is centrally located with great natural sunlight in the living area. It is a simple place good for sleeping while you're out exploring the city for the majority of the day.
1653819,24019169,2014-12-17,2572265,Mel,The flat was just as described  centrally located  sunny and clean. Connell was there to greet us and was very helpful in general. Fully equipped kitchen  laundry and parking just around the corner. We had a great time. It's definitely not a quiet retreat  but we loved the hustle and bustle of City Bowl. Would totally recommend this spot.
1653819,24355692,2014-12-27,2732212,Elliott,Connell was a great host and helped us with precise directions from the airport to the flat. The flat itself is centrally located downtown Cape Town within walking distance of great restaurants and bars on Long St. and very close to the HOPO tour bus and metro bus stations to get you further around the city to Table Mtn  Camps Bay and the like. Building is secure and is inside the ever bustling Green Market Square. The flat is small and quaint and in a great location. We enjoyed our stay very much.
1653819,24547608,2014-12-30,655247,April,Connell was easily available and even met us at the flat for our late arrival. The flat was everything we needed  overlooking a market square and where there were a couple of cafes and restaurants. It's just 2 blocks from the red sightseeing bus stop which was very convenient. There was a guard downstairs at all times so we felt relatively safe.
1653819,24805578,2015-01-03,18981977,Antonia,Connell was a great host  who gave us a lot of informations. The flat is located in the heart of Cape Town... the perfect starting point for all of our activities. We really enjoyed staying there 
1653819,26094633,2015-02-03,22138421,Ramya,We could not have asked for a better location. It was convenient and has alot of eating options just below and across the road. The best souvenir shopping is just outside with the greenmarket square vendors. Easy access to public transport and the hop on hop off office. Connell is an awesome host - he went the extra mile and even got us a fan when we requested for it. He also picked us up from the airport when we arrived in CPT. My husband and I had a great time in Capetown and it has largely to do with the excellent accommodation.
1653819,26445312,2015-02-13,12693883,Ina,It has been a great appartment with a perfect  central location. Connell provided us with great tips and the house was very clean and well maintained. In the morning you could hear the noise of the market a bit  but that was no big deal.
1653819,26739928,2015-02-18,25767539,Ashley,Thank you to Connell for a wonderful experience while staying at his flat in GreenMarket Square. Just as advertised  the place is situated in the heart of the city - close to restaurants  local shops  and public transit. Connell was readily available whenever we needed him - which wasn't often as everything in the place is perfectly functional and comfortable We loved having tea on the balcony at night  watching the market vendors take down their stalls for the evening. This is a perfect place to stay to enjoy the Cape Town city centre. We would most definitely come back - and would recommend this place to our friends
1653819,28255942,2015-03-21,5896815,Simone,Everything was just perfect  located in the heart of town  restaurants nearby  the apartement is fully equipped with everything one might need. Connell has good tipps for exploring the City and always helpful. Very easy to contact. Would definitely come back to this place. In the morning it is a little bit noisy  because the market is being set up.

1653819,28923671,2015-04-01,22136940,Barbara,After 24 hours of flying and airport transfers  Connell met us at the airport at 1130pm What more could we expect from a host Well before leaving us that night he gave a very good summary of the local restaurants and a recommendation for breakfast - all within a short walk of his flat. A great base for our five day stay in Cape Town - very close to bus stop 5 for the red  blue  yellow bus routes  the street arts and craft markets and upmarket souvenir shops.
1653819,29381100,2015-04-07,3673080,Suganya,The market house apartment was perfect for our week-long vacation to Cape Town. It was easy to walk to the nearby restaurants and shops and Connell was extremely helpful in giving us directions when we got lost on our first day. The apartment had everything we needed and was clean  and comfortable.
1653819,30222957,2015-04-19,29804811,Joanna,This was our first time using airbnb.

1653819,37938943,2015-07-12,8362211,John  Robin,Connell was at the airport waiting for us with a friendly smile and a handshake. He gave us an overview of Cape Town as he drove us to the apartment. His place was efficient and the location was perfect. We found the apartment to be exactly as advertised.
1653819,41980387,2015-08-10,3789604,Lindsay,We enjoyed our stay at Connell's apartment in Cape Town which is tidy and centrally located  with a great little balcony overlooking Greenmarket Square. Connell was helpful and easy to communicate with. The only downside was the noise from the square and an adjoining balcony but with so much to do all day in Cape Town we slept fine at night
1653819,43982603,2015-08-23,38569608,Aaron,The apartment is well suited and in a great location in the center of the city

2000857,688231375563507850,2022-08-07,1881852,Mohammed,The location was great  few foot steps  you are by the ocean. Secure area and secured building. Groceries stores and good cafe and restaurants few hundreds of meters away. The place is just what you had seen in the pictures. Host is very hospitable  she was the icing of the cake.
2000857,728088653735128687,2022-10-01,180866788,Mohammed,Words fail to express how amazing the unit is  and how exceptional Louise is as a host. She has gone above and beyond in so many ways to make this excellent stay even better. The unit is a work of art  very apparent that a tremendous amount and quality of interior design taste was applied here. Every angle had its own story  colors  and it all meshed together very beautifully. What complemented it as well are the great recommendations by Louise of places to go to  and things to do. Again  all of the above doesnt even come close to describing how very welcomed did we feel  and how amazing the stay was  and how hospitable and friendly Louise is. Weve had the pleasure
2000857,733153608546530599,2022-10-08,27298368,Lila,Louise's place is a delight Great design  perfectly located and equipped with everything we needed. Louise was a fantastic host  fast communication and accommodating  with a ton of great recommendations for the area. Would love to visit again

1653819,53106574,2015-11-05,4684314,Frans,The apartment is located on Green Market in a beautiful Art Deco facade. Connell picked us up from the airport which was great. The apartment was well equipped  the bed was comfortable and the kitchen had all the appliances  The douche was great. The location was wonderful everything was in walking distance of the apartment. We had a great time watching the market being build and up and taken down. We truly enjoyed our time in the apartment as in Cape Town.  We recommend this apartment it was absolutely perfect.
1653819,54263587,2015-11-17,4654227,Carmen,Connell was a very welcoming host and the flat was great Awesome location  and despite being in the middle of everything  very quiet in the bedroom. I really loved having the city at my doorstep and would definitely stay at Connell's place again
1653819,54485820,2015-11-20,49165721,Jonathan,Connell was superbly efficient and available from the moment that we made the reservation through Airbnb. He was timeous and accommodating. I really would like to say that the building  the location and the experience were all fantastic and I highly recommend Connell and the apartment at 402 Market House. Thank you for a wonderful time.
1653819,54976365,2015-11-27,40687742,Lara,Great apartment in the city centre. Connell was a lovely host  very helpful.
1653819,55342993,2015-12-01,33285837,Shift,Well what can I say. Connell is a true gentleman in every sense of the word. Even before reaching Cape Town interactions with Connell was lovely. Apartment is superbly located smack down in the middle of town. Close to everything you might need. Clean  spacious and safe with security personnel stationed at the ground floor. And the bird's eye view of Greenmarket Square from right under your nose makes for a great view. Thank you Connell for the wonderful hospitality. Five stars out of five
1653819,55977545,2015-12-07,7154518,Tiff  Luan,Connell was very friendly and extremely helpful with great advice about the area  the apartment  places to go and things to see. Connell's apartment was top notch. Everything was exactly as described and the location was simply amazing. The kitchen comes with everything you need  iron and ironing board were available and the internet was great as well. Everything was clean and worked without any reason for complaints. If my work of leisure ever takes me back to Cape Town  I would not hesitate to stay at Connell's again  if he'll have me.
1653819,59840319,2016-01-16,51334344,Marcus,The apt was a great place It was in a great location and the Market Place was so cultural.
1653819,60381961,2016-01-23,6361640,Uta,Conell is a wonderful person  the flat is exactly as the description. It is a wonderful place  where life is going on... I will return in two weaks
1653819,60880654,2016-01-29,4110944,Mark,If you are unfamiliar with transport options or arrive late in the evening as we did Connell's airport pick up service is a good option. His orientation was thorough and everything in the apartment was clean and in above average working order. New drapes and nice art work on the walls. Don't forget your soap bar as we did  bring shampoo too. Unfortunately for me  I started a medicine that caused light sleep. I was glad to have the eye mask and ear plugs from the flight in. We had the windows open to get some cool air  the down side was the early morning noise erupting from the many stalls that are set up as they were assembling long poles which occasionally bang and clang. Also the light though dim streams in through both hallways when the bedroom door is open.  A strong positive is the convenient location to the city center services and amenities.
1653819,63063980,2016-02-20,50368554,Luisa,We had a great stay there and the appartment is really really nice. A lot of Restaurants around and a little market in front of the door. Recommendable
1653819,63697651,2016-02-26,39006455,Brenda,Connell made us very welcome and met us in the square where we were being dropped off. He showed us round the apartment. He provided tea and coffee  which was very welcome.  The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom with lovely towels was great.  There were full cooking facilities which we didn't make a lot of use of because there were so many cafes and restaurants on our doorstep.   The apartment was very central and very convenient for exploring Cape Town. The market in the square was very busy and the stall holders built and dismantle led their stalls daily  which  although noisy added to the charm and gave us an insight to how much hard work went on with the stall holders.  I would definitely recommend staying here to get a feel of Cape Town.  If we ever visit Cape Town again we would definitely stay there again.
2000857,868722303374799776,2023-04-13,19968967,Courtney,Incredibly smooth check-inout process and Louise was very communicative throughout. Great location right in the heart of Sea Point and the backup generator was clutch while we worked from home

1653819,67679091,2016-03-30,56195564,Daniela,We felt very welcome as soon as we met Connell. The apartment was clean and comfortable  and in a very great central location. Would definitely recommend this apartment and rent again if I return to Cape Town
1653819,73242992,2016-05-07,11347981,Darius,Really great apt centrally located to everything you could want or need. The hosts  Colleen and his wife  are extremely nice and helpful. I'd recommend their place to anyone visiting Capetown.
1653819,93810363,2016-08-14,12380022,Edwige,Connell est trs accueillant  l appartement est idalement plac  nous. Avonst ravi de sjourner chez lui...
1653819,99477686,2016-09-05,84402964,Stefanie,The apartment was very clean and comfortable . The location is very central. Connell is a very nice and supprting host. If I travel again to Cape Town I would book this apartment again  too.
1653819,102358302,2016-09-17,11313991,Rhonda,Our host picked us up at the airport fir a fee.  After our 36 hours of travel  it was nice to not have to worry anout anything.
1653819,106128411,2016-10-04,91811067,Alex,Connell is the perfect host He patiently waited for us to arrive even though it was during the night. He gave us great recommendations to any question we asked. He was always available for communication. Having laundry in the apartment was great for our long stay. The location is literally right above Greenmarket Square in downtown Cape Town. We would drink our morning coffee while watching them set up the shops.
1653819,107382823,2016-10-10,1218004,Tom,Connell is a great guy  and the apartment is wonderful. Great location  clean and everything that you would need for a short or long stay in Cape Town. He explained briefly about the period  and gave some great advice on what to do Can't recommend the place enough  just a great spot in Cape Town.
1653819,109761996,2016-10-23,95097284,Joe,Fantastic apartment right in the city centre  this place is so close to all the sights of CT. Connell was a great host greeting on arrival and departure.
1653819,116636498,2016-12-02,2772570,Mark,All of the previous reviews were the main reason we selected Connell's Air-BnB and it did not disappoint. In terms of our top reasons why we loved his place 1 central location - it was only a block away from Hop-on-Hop-off bus tours  which is one of the best ways to get around town if you don't have a car  it's also central and easily walkable to other points of interest such as BoKaap  District 6  and of course Greenmarket Square which is just outside of the door 2 security - the building has a doorman and has a separate key for accessing the building 3 accommodations - there is a relatively large bathroom and we had no problems with hot water  etc.  the kitchenliving space was big with a small balcony facing the main square it would have been a bonus if there was a small sofa to sit on  rather than dining room chairs  the bedroom is relatively large but in the back of the unit...but you aren't in Cape Town to sleep  and 4 Connell is an amazing host. He met us right at our agreed upon time  gave us such a great perspective of life and politics in South Africa  and went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed like a fan.
1653819,122525328,2016-12-24,8783672,Michiel,Great appartment  you can't get any closer to the vibrant centre of Cape Town CBD. Connell was a very welcoming host and helped us with everything. Perfect WiFi  it felt very safe and everything is on walking distance. So no complaints at all.
1653819,127315840,2017-01-17,13583519,Souni,We couldn't not have asked for a better place to explore Cape Town. The place is clean  well equipped and so central. Connell is available and care about his town. It's a lot of fun to just sit on the balcony and watch the crowd of shops from above. It's a great value and highly recommended
1653819,129880194,2017-02-03,50818998,Jop,Amazing location on a very busy square. Parking garage close by for 100 rand a night.
1653819,131172700,2017-02-11,14345,Konrad,The place is in a great location  I could walk from the flat to almost all attractions. The flat has a great balcony and an amazing view on the market in front. Enjoyed this home base to explore the city very much Thanks Connell for picking me up at the airport and getting me back to the airport on the last day - it's great to start and end the Cape Town experience with such a friendly and open host.
1653819,133225835,2017-02-21,19509554,Alex,Connell was great and the location was just as described. Just be aware the wifi is very slow so keep that in mind if you need to get any type of remote work done on the computer. Otherwise  I'd highly recommend
1653819,133849443,2017-02-25,16023127,Matt,great location  great place to stay.
1653819,134638545,2017-02-28,38529500,Adlade,Connell is the perfect host  he is easy to communicate with and has been warmly welcoming us at our arrival  giving us great tips for our few days in Cape Town. The apartment was easy to find  clean  perfectly  located and quiet at night. I recommend it 100 and would stay there again if I have the chance to come back.
1653819,136198851,2017-03-09,13501296,Athena,The apartment was quite good and the location was perfect  Connell was really nice and easy to contact. The only thing that could be better was the cleaning of the bathroom - had to do it myself
2007991,25904678,2015-01-29,16117081,James,Joy's communication was great throughout and the house was perfect for our needs in Cape Town. She was not in town when we visited but her neighbour Kai was also very helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again
2007991,27245272,2015-03-01,1514723,Philipp,Ein traumhaftes Haus in einer traumhaften Lage. Innenstadt  Longstreet  Waterkant und Waterfront sind fulufig erreichbar. Das Haus liegt in unmittelbarer Nhe zu den bekannten  bunten Bokaap-Husern  die man aus vielen Reisefhrern kennt. Joy war bei Fragen immer schnell und unkompliziert erreichbar. Kleiner Tipp fr Reisende kauft eine SIM-Card fr's Handy und nutzt statt Taxis lieber Uber. Ist zuverlssiger und gnstiger.
2007991,56721934,2015-12-17,37302899,Alistair,We really loved our stay in Joy's home. It is even more beautiful than the pictures let on - full of character with a great garden and wonderful views. And it's unbelievably central  easy to get to  close to all the good stuff. Joy is super friendly and went out of her way to meet us at a time that was convenient for us and to fix any issues we had. She also let us bring our puppy and he had a great time too The Bo Kaap is an amazing experience with its distinct culture and colourful houses I loved that we could hear the call to prayer from the house. The downside of the Bo Kaap is petty crime and our car was broken into while parked on the street. But so long as you make sure you leave nothing in there  it should be fine. I would definitely stay here again We had a great time.
1653819,139185000,2017-03-24,48408734,Emily,We had a wonderful stay at Connell's place He was so kind to pick us up from the airport and even waited quite a while as we went through customs. The apartment was right in the city center  the perfect location. Everything in the apartment was as described. There is a fan in the bedroom which was nice to have for the warmer nights. The kitchen has everything you need but it's great to eat out in Cape Town since everything is quite cheap The wifi was a tad slow but everything else was just perfect. We absolutely loved Cape Town. Thank you Connell
1653819,139994213,2017-03-27,5872702,Layla,Connell went the extra mile to ensure we had a great stay. The flat is lovely and gets beautiful sunlight in the kitchen. Would highly recommend
1653819,140897574,2017-04-01,73010380,Maria Lygia,if you're looking for comfort and facility to walk around the city  this apartment is very good. Location is perfect and very confortable. For sure if i go back to Cape Town  i will stay here again
1653819,143546203,2017-04-12,46301870,Andrew,Great location  market is lively yet quiet at night. Walkable to restaurants  harbor. Connell is a very gracious host
1653819,146663555,2017-04-23,56013778,Sjoerd,Is just a perfect location on a beautiful market.
1653819,147682169,2017-04-28,34973685,Carmine,What an amazing stay Cozy apartment in the city center  everything you need is there And Connel is really a great host. Highly recomended
1653819,149423953,2017-05-04,22594857,Avinash,This place has got a great location. And the facilities are quite adequate for a couple or two friends. Connell is a very responsive host and always happy to help.
1653819,151927218,2017-05-14,34145385,Bethany,This apartment is IDEAL for seeing the best of Capetown It's smack dab in the middle of everything.  Free walking tours start right outside the door  there is fun live entertainment right outside too  Everything was set up for a great stay Honestly though  the apartment was clean  cozy  safe  well equipped and centrally located.
1653819,160250747,2017-06-13,41163732,Robert,Great wifi and great shower
1653819,163323687,2017-06-24,22708714,Andy,Great location and cozy apartment. Really felt comfortable.
1653819,166928279,2017-07-05,72977491,Chin,Unit was neat and tidy. Most basic needs were met. Good location walkable to nearby restaurants and cafes.
1653819,168857380,2017-07-10,22350042,Bridget,This is an ideal location for being in the middle of everything  quick access to the roadways and a wonderfully appointed apartment. I loved waking up to the clock tower and the sounds of the market coming to life each morning. Plenty of shops  restaurants and sights within walking distance. Quiet nights so we were well rested in the morning and ready to explore Cape Town
1653819,180806769,2017-08-11,86253648,Sissel,This apartment suited us perfectly. Nice  bight and clean. To sitt on the balcony and observe the market wake up in the morning before you take a stroll down to Cafe Honeybun for breakfast  that is realy nice. If you like the feeling of being in the heart of the city  then you would love this place. When I'm heading back to Cape Town  this is the place I will stay.
1653819,183722553,2017-08-18,135321633,Ahmad,Neville's place is in an excellent location  not too far at all from all the major sites in Cape town. The flat is in a secure location with a security guard at the entrance 24 hours a day. There was ample supply of towels etc  and everything was in working order. WiFi connection was good. It was a pleasure to meet Neville at the end of our visit despite the miscommunication surrounding our checkout time. Thanks for letting us stay
1653819,190070297,2017-09-03,11728192,Andreea,We really enjoyed Cape Town and this is also thanks to the lovely flat at Market House The location is perfect  in an area full of restaurants  pubs and gift shops. As a bonus for us  the Free Walking Tour Cape Town starts right downstairs. The flat was clean and cozy  with a lovely kitchen and balcony where we could watch over the Market Square. Connell gave us a warm welcome  and he really made an effort that everything was alright while we stayed at his place. This is the first time we use AirBnb so we didn't know what to expect  but the experience was really good and we'll repeat it for sure. I'd recommend the Market House to everyone who'd like to visit Cape Town.  Thanks Connell
2007991,131673540,2017-02-13,3616575,Dominic,Excellent stay. Would love to come back.
1653819,201894296,2017-10-09,396159,Robyn,Market House is a gr8 base to explore Cape Town. Walk or take the Hop on Hop off bus just 3 minutes away  enjoy vibrant Green market Square and restaurants  cafes  money changing  shopping etc on your doorstep. Quiet and secure. My second stay here. I also appreciated Connell's airport transfers and insights into living in Western Cape.
1653819,204296884,2017-10-17,146273384,Patrick,Great host and perfect apartment The flat was very clean  comfortable and has an amazing view on greenmarket square. It is surrounded by excellent restaurants and cosy bars. Thank you Connell for transport to the airport and your great support. Recommendable
1653819,208770601,2017-11-03,2817001,Christophe,Comfortable apartment with all necessary equipment and Connell always ready to help he checked with the provider about the slow wifi situation during my stay. Great location during daytime. Recommended.
1653819,212769351,2017-11-19,133599457,Ulrich,If you are looking for a nice place right in the heart of the city rather than a quiet place on the outskirts of town  there is no better place to find  we believe. You can reach a lot of onterestig sites by foot  bus stations are near  shops and restaurants only a few steps away and Greenmarket just underneath you. The sleeping room is in the back  so you can shut off the market noise. Just in case you want to cook yourself  there is a well equipped kitchen. And if you encounter any problem Connell will help you like a friend
1653819,213623075,2017-11-22,121384736,Kate,Connell was a very gracious and welcoming host The place was clean and we loved the security feature to the building. Can't wait to come back
1653819,215718449,2017-12-01,5529463,Sheila,Connell's flat was clean  and the location was very convenient. Connell was there to greet us and to say goodbye.
1653819,218653421,2017-12-14,108439212,Ming,The location of the apartment is safe  accessible and convinient  with lots of restaurantsshops nearby Connell is a wonderful host and his apartment also had everything we needed We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend fellow travellers to stay in Connells place
1653819,220175914,2017-12-21,28005156,Andrea,O lugar do Connell  exatamente como nas fotos  ele  super receptivo e nos deu timas dicas do que fazer na cidade A localizao  tima  estando prxima a restaurantes na Long St assim como  rota para qualquer lado da cidade Recomendo
1653819,227970545,2018-01-17,94338046,Annette,Everything that we needed was in the apartment. It was very clean and wonderfully located in Greenmarket Square. The hop-on hop-off buses were very close. The free walking tours where within the square. Wonderful places to eat and shop everywhere. Connell was a wealth of information and a wonderful host
1653819,229162601,2018-01-22,16383201,Lyndsey,Great value for the central location. Close to lots of restaurants and bar  although being so close to the market does mean it is a bit noisy. Otherwise great
1653819,232100234,2018-02-04,38905059,Jan Pieter,Lovely Place
1653819,237466491,2018-02-23,52696821,Camille,Ce logement est parfaitement situ pour profiter de la ville de Cape Town. Vous tes  deux pas dune foule de bons restaurants et du Food lovers market o vous trouverez dexcellent repas prs  emporter  un prix plus que comptitif. Il y a galement une picerie  distance de marche. Les autobus touristique de type hop on hop off sont  un coin de rue. Vous pouvez facilement silloner la ville  bord de ces autobus. Laccueil de Connell est impcable  il est dune grande gentillesse et trs amical. Il est venu nous chercher  laroport alors que nous arrivions en fin de soire. Un service que nous avons grandement apprci aprs un long vol. La Greenmarket place est anime de 6 heures le matin  9 heures le soir. Il y a souvent de la musique et videmment les commerants de la place. La nuit a demeure trs tranquille et vous pouvez dormir sur vos deux oreilles. Notre seul bmol concerne la propret de lappartement qui tait un peu poussireux. Mais il faut dire que nous sommes passs au moment ou la ville vivait une grande scheresse et que laccs a leau tait trs limite. Cependant  Connell change les draps et les serviettes chaque semaine ce qui est plutt rare dans les locations de ce genre. Bref cet appartement a un bon rapport qualit prix compte tenu de sa situation gographique et de la gentillesse de son propritaire. Merci pour tout Connel.
1653819,239512736,2018-03-02,1038160,Jon And Jenny,Nevilles Place is very well located. It overlooks Market Square. Connell communicated well  met us on arrival and came to say goodbye at the end. Highly recommended.
1653819,240980363,2018-03-07,67688905,Sandrine,Connell is a great host The apartment was spacious  clean and in the city center. We really enjoyed our stay there Thank you again 
2007991,137899763,2017-03-18,2901614,Karina,We loved staying at Joy's place in the Bo Kaap  which was such an interesting and eclectic neighbourhood. The villa was very nicely decorated and provided everything we needed. Communication with Joy was quick and easy. Our favourite part of the place was the beautiful big garden with views of table mountain and the rest of the city as the house is on a hill We really enjoyed our morning teas outside in the sunshine surrounded by palm trees Thanks again for hosting us Joy
2007991,165536471,2017-07-01,540695,Talor,lovely  just lovely. lovely house  lovely views  lovely hosts. in the vibrantly colorful neighborhood of bo kaap  i'd wake to the beautiful sound of the muezzin's call to prayer and sip coffee while watching a gorgeous sunrise. this spacious 2-story house is comfortable  clean and well equipped for a self-catering holiday. joy  frances and sebastian the dog are warm  friendly and very helpful. highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a more authentic experience during their stay in cape town.
2007991,183431646,2017-08-17,116846028,Susanna,A good location if you don't have a car  cause many things are within walking distance. The house has everything you need and is very comfortable. The host works from home so you can ask anything if needed.
2007991,225693650,2018-01-07,77825548,Rafe,A beautiful view of Table Mountain  style  and peace.  That's what you can expect.   Not to mention being extremely central Definitely one of the best places one could stay and for a great price
2007991,249378185,2018-04-02,133524342,Elze,Beautiful place to stay  with everything you need. The location is fantastic Joy  was a wonderful host.
2007991,274404166,2018-06-09,6837978,Yasmine,The place is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Joy is a friendly host and always responds fast to inquiries. The flat is clean  and had all the needed amenities for my stay  with a bottle of wine as special touch. The garden is such a nice break from the city. Despite the place itself being nice  the downside was the area of Bo-kaap which is fairly dangerous with no security or cameras around.
2007991,349006491,2018-11-16,66966258,Genevive,Lovely place  we stay 1 month there and we loved having our place right near to everything Joy has good taste and you have everything you need there. Only the shower may be low on water some times. Otherwise everything is perfect. If you go to Capetown  I highly recommend this little jewelry 
2007991,359091100,2018-12-16,15316909,Florian,We spent approx a month in Joy's house and had a wonderful time. The house is very charming and light and it's everything there  you need for a nice stay. The property itself has a nice garden and as it's located on a little hill  the view is amazing. Also we felt safe all the time. On the property there is the house and three more apartments. The other people were very nice and we experienced good vibes in our little neighbourhood. Also the two lovely dogs contributed their share. A good supermarket is in walking distance. The popular Bree Street is nearby. Many thanks again
2007991,591452692,2020-01-11,82470615,Jeremy,Amazing view Very comfortable apartment. Would love to come back
2013198,24465875,2014-12-29,12557287,Arianna,Highly recommended This is a little great Anthropologie-style apartment in the heart of Green Point. Pictures don't make it justice. Lots of nice details. Position is perfect--you can walk to Green Point park  to great restaurants and deli  to VA  to the Sea Point promenade. You can also catch cabs right outside the door. The only thing--I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you have a 2yo because there are a lot of things that could break. I also wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you are planning to cook a lot because there is not a real dining table more of a breakfast table. Recommended in all other cases  it is perfect.
2013198,24819762,2015-01-03,22254650,Iman,Amazing and very clean appartment Just positive memories
1653819,246816016,2018-03-26,66702469,Caro,Die Wohnung ist direkt am Greenmarket Square. Beste Lage Schlafzimmer ist nach hinten raus und ruhig Der Balkon bietet eine ideale Aussicht. Die Ausstattung ist hervorragend. Wir wurden sogar vom Flughafen abgeholt Fazit toller Gastgeber  tolle Wohnung Absolut empfehlenswert
1653819,248810635,2018-04-01,128550419,Lindsey,We had quite a lovely stay at Connell's place. It is perfectly located in the market square  which is super accessible for tourists. Plenty to do  see  eat and buy in the market below. Cape Town over all was stunning  and Connell was very hospitable. He picked us up from the airport  told us about the city and much more and was very friendly. We'll certainly be back
1653819,254622836,2018-04-17,80741025,Roger,Connell met us at the house to get us settled in. He is very hospitable and was a pleasure to meet. The house is close to many restaurants. It is very close  2-3 min walk  to one of the hop onoff bus stops and office. The only downside is the wifi slowed down considerably in the evening but I would not hesitate to stay here again.
1653819,261793834,2018-05-07,182607303,Monet,Amazing host and space I highly recommend.
1653819,264600737,2018-05-14,130069117,Ken,Connell was very helpful and quick to respond. The location of his suite was great and we had a wonderful stay exploring the city. Highly recommend
1653819,271067458,2018-05-31,94055990,Emily,Great place  great host  great location. The only thing that was missing was strong internet.
1653819,328511284,2018-09-26,183243661,Holly,hopefully  after Connell reads review he will fix and update info on accommodation.
1653819,332893559,2018-10-06,12087810,Michal,The place is located in the very heart of the city centre  safeguarded and Connell is very responsive. It is generally a good value for money  however  the place is exposed to quite some noise coming from Green Market to the kitchen and the inner hall to the bedroom  internet is not reliable and when it's cold outside the apartment is freezing. We were also unlucky as the entire front of the building was covered with scaffolding due to some works of which we got to know upon arrival and the washing machine didn't work.
1653819,337768243,2018-10-17,60116075,Gillian,Location couldn't be better  absolutely central for Cape Town city centre  comfortable walking distance for all the city centre sights. Previous reviews had mentioned poor internet speeds   Connell himself warned me of it  but I had no problem at all with it. The flat is small  but nicely furnished  the bedroom  bathroom were spotless. The only problem was that the entire building was shrouded in scaffolding as it was being cleaned  having structural repairs done. This meant the little balcony couldn't be used  the view over Greenmarket Square was almost completely obscured  the kitchen  which the balcony opens on to  had an inescapable layer of fine  gritty dust from the work taking place outside. I had to make sure the curtains were drawn at night  not opened in the morning until I was fully dressed as there were occasionally workmen walking past - not a problem I'd expected on the 4th floor  I can't say it especially spoiled my stay  but it was disappointing I'd looked forward to sitting looking at the world below me from the balcony.
1653819,347868609,2018-11-12,25326266,Sandra,We are seniors and we appreciated how gracious and thought Connell was as her provided transportation from the airport to his place and gave us great help in getting around Cape Town. His place is clean  well equipped and centrally located on the interesting Green Market Square. This provided an ideal location for discovering Cape Town.
1653819,349349824,2018-11-17,104513719,Can,Everything was as described. Connell is a great host and the communication went very well and fast. I will come again
1653819,350725161,2018-11-20,94437063,Benjamin,Connell did everything to make our stay comfortable. We didnt know where to park so he just came down to guide us through the streets. The location is really in the center of Cape Town with many restaurants and bars in walking distance. We would definitely recommend this place to explore the city
1653819,352339172,2018-11-25,22625736,Maria Alejandra,Connells apartment is great. Very clean  great location. There is a really nice craft market just outside Connell was very thoughtful and waited for us in the apartment even when our flight was delayed. I strongly recommend you to stay here.

1653819,366680456,2019-01-03,109149844,Anton,Very nice stay  thanks
1653819,403001516,2019-01-20,45574291,Jill,We loved our 5 days at the apartment and would love to have stayed longer Its great to be on the balcony overlooking the hustle and bustle of Greenmarket Square  being right in the heart of the city. The free walking tours from the Motherland Cafe just round the corner  are brilliant the hop on and off bus is just across the square and a brilliant way to see the city and to get to Table Mountain. The Food Lovers Market  on the square  sells delicious and cheap food to eat back in the apartment. Connell is a fantastic host too. Really recommended to embrace city life
1653819,410010176,2019-02-09,12180727,Georges,We had a great time in Capetown thanks to Connells flat location which is just PERFECT You are in the heart of the town which is very handy because everything  you need is in walking distance. The flat is very nice with a balcony overlooking the Green Market Place and very well equipped and clean. We had a problem with the WiFi and Connell came to help immediately. He even brought us a telephone so that we could call home and tell them we had arrived safely in Capetown Connell is a very friendly and outgoing person who knows a lot about the town history. So dont miss that go to Market Place you cant find a better place
1653819,411642002,2019-02-13,227249328,Maury,Great place to stay Connell is a wonderful host. Apartment is clean and neat  centrally located  with food  transport and shopping right out the front door of the building.
1653819,413113668,2019-02-17,60501620,Sylvia,Great value for money in a very central location.
1653819,415214246,2019-02-22,38837385,Andrew,Great place with excellent location
1653819,419895771,2019-03-05,11700961,Nina,We had a very nice stay at Connell's place It is the perfect location  right in the city center with all the shops and Long Street just around the corner. We felt very safe there are security guys. The apartment is clean and well equipped. The bedroom is spacious and and we slept very well - depending how sensitive you are with noise  it can be a bit louder in the morning with Green Market Square just out front  but when you close all doors it is not a problem at all. Connell is very friendly and open-minded and we would definitely recommend staying at his place 
1653819,420892724,2019-03-08,57102682,Ibai,apartamento bien ubicado. un poco de ruido a las 6 AM por el mercado  toca madrugar
1653819,426792886,2019-03-22,17868388,Willem,A better place to stay in Cape Town I wouldnt know of one. Right in the middle of the city. On a nice square. Always things to see from your nice balcony. Save  with a 247 watch at the door. The Apartment has all you need. The bedroom windows look at stairway but this is no problem. Connell is very friendly  he met me at the AirPort late in the evening against a very reasonable cost. His good morning message  next morning  was that extra touch that makes a person happy. The car I rented later on was savely stored at the parking right around the corner. All in all  highly recommended
1653819,443075017,2019-04-25,39463220,Lukas,The stay at Connell's flat couldn't have been any better. The flat is conveniently located right in the middle of City Centre so that many sights are in walking distance. Although the busy and sometimes noisy Greenmarket Square is right in front of it  the bedroom is nice and quiet as it lays backwards. Communication with Connell was also super easy. To recommend
1653819,445485111,2019-04-29,59513307,Charlotte,Nice location and great appartment.
2013198,29516957,2015-04-08,29609590,Jill,Kat greeted us with a beautiful bright smile and warm hug. We felt comfortable immediately. She gave us a quick tour of her apartment  made sure we had all we needed. Street parking was super easy.
2013198,53598004,2015-11-10,84051,Doug,Kat's home was the perfect stop-gap for my initial stay in Cape Town before I found something more permanent. The flat is fully furnished and included everything I needed for a comfortable end enjoyable stay in a vibrant area.
2013198,70203047,2016-04-17,34710729,Andres,the apartment is just as described. location is super we always felt secure not only in the apartment  but also on the street infront of it. very nice location do travel around cape town. can highly recommend this place
2013198,71097646,2016-04-23,8424239,Christiane,We had a great stay at Kat's home in the Cape. It is very spacious  light and comfortable it is decorated with great taste and equipped with all that is needed for a confortable stay. The appartment complex is very well located within short distance of the Waterfront area and within walking distance of several shopping and dining options. We would stay there with great pleasure on our next visit.
2013198,122804450,2016-12-26,6892416,Sophie,The location of the flat was absolutely perfect  close to many restaurants  across green park  with great playgrounds for our kids  in walking distance from waterfront and the Sea Point promenade  exactly what we were looking for. The flat is situated in a quiet complex with little gardens  which was nice. I was a bit worried that our 18 month would find plenty of things to break in the flat but it was ok. The table with high stools are not easy with children  especially a toddler - but w could have guessed it from the pictures.
2013198,210768192,2017-11-11,89757821,Andrea,Kat's place is adorable and we loved calling it home during our time in Capetown. The location is great  walking distance to VA waterfront  a Spar grocery store and other shops and restaurants. The decorations are lovely and the patio and garden area are so nice to relax...plus the couch is so comfy Check-in and out were super easy and Rita the house manager was so accommodating for us. Thank you
1653819,504767890,2019-08-08,88402784,Harish,Amazing stay with an even better hospitality

1653819,539460941,2019-10-01,211603161,Joanne,The place was great very clean and convenient spot. There is a security guard downstairs and the place is super safe.
1653819,544069615,2019-10-09,180548639,Joo Arthur,Apartamento com excelente espao para um casal  limpo e organizado. A localizao  bem no centro da cidade   nos permitiu fazer vrios passeios a p.
1653819,553544217,2019-10-24,29349411,Stephanie,Great location at city center within 15 mins walk or an easy Uber to most major attractions. Please note that the apartment faces a square where market vendors will start their setup at 6am onwards  and that the bedroom is adjacent to a fire escape where people sometime smoke. At the time we stayed  there were refugees camping out at the adjacent street where the UN HQ was located. Cape Town is a great city
1653819,568941328,2019-11-25,306494147,Sophia,Super Lage  sauber und unkompliziert. Gerne wieder.
1653819,576298369,2019-12-13,114434893,Laura,Great location. A block way from the Baz Bus office which does an excellent Cape Peninsula tour  2 blocks from the hop on hop off bus which goes to all the major places in town and right next to dozens of restaurants  tour companies and shopping. I was a female traveling alone and felt perfectly safe but it is the side of town that many caution not to go out at night  which I didnt. If youre looking for a safe  comfortable and convenient  home base while you run around town but dont like the idea of staying in a hostel  stay at Connells place. Also  pay the small amount of extra money and arrange pick up and drop off from the airport with Connell  hes great company and will give lots of tips and answer any questions.
1653819,578900801,2019-12-19,115897684,Paul,Very nice
1653819,580110952,2019-12-22,225839206,Keetan,Great place. Connell made sure we felt at home and ensured the place was spotless prior to our arrival.
1653819,590664559,2020-01-09,14437684,Thomas,Die Wohnung ist wirklich wundervoll zentral. Man kann viele Sehenswrdigkeiten zu Fu erreichen. Gut auch fr Nachtschwrmer. In unmittelbarer Umgebung gibt es viele Restaurants und Bars. Leider aber wird der tgliche Markt morgens auf und abends abgebaut  was doch recht laut ist. Die Wohnung ist gerumig mit einer schnen Wohnkche und tollem Blick auf die Stadt. Aber leider hat das Schlafzimmer nur ein Fenster zum innenliegenden Treppenhaus und somit keine Frischluftzufuhr. Der Kontakt zum Vermieter war sehr nett.
1653819,594730825,2020-01-19,306421126,Maximilian,Great place to stay
1653819,597673873,2020-01-26,81481902,Paolo,luogo perfetto per chi vuole visitare cape town  si  vicini praticamente a tutti i luoghi di interesse Connel  una persona gentile e simpatica raccomando questo posto....
1653819,605649895,2020-02-15,11178173,Jueun,Connell is one of the best host Ive ever met in airbnb Love his place located in heart of CBD and well definitely be back next time
1653819,609010437,2020-02-22,282074814,Danielle,The location is very good in terms of convenience. The city sightseeing double decker bus great value for the cost has a stop right on the next corner  and there are several places to grab a quick coffee  and excellent dine-in options nearby. Its also a good apartment if you plan to cook  as hes left it fully equipped and theres a grocery nearby. Waterfront is a quick cheap Uber ride dont use taxis. Apartment is very clean and Connell met me at the airport  and dropped me back to the airport despite an early flight. He really wants to make sure you feel welcomed and is invested in you being happy with your experience.
1653819,612186298,2020-02-29,125251435,Carolina,Buena ubicacin sobre todo si te gusta la artesana  en uber te puedes mover por todos lados sin problema. Si la primera noche no sabiamos como se ponia el sector cuando se oscureci y pasamos un poco de susto buscando un negocio para comprar algo que comer. Muy oscuro  gente vive alrededor de green market en la calle.  Connell muy preocupado de todo  muchas gracias
1653819,620432686,2020-03-22,277814182,Dilan,I'm really glad that I booked with Connell. It's not often that you meet a person as friendly and caring as Connell. His apartment is also quite good  except for the fact that the windows in the bedroom show into the apartment. So it is not possible to air out. Nevertheless  the apartment is equipped with everything you need. I had a very good stay and I would book again with Connell.
1653819,736645392,2021-03-06,377306982,Ocean,Beautiful place with a balcony overlooking the market square...perfect for morning coffee or sundowners
1653819,425125754458988760,2021-08-09,416239123,Vanessa,Loved  loved  loved our stay at Market House. Market house is right on Greenmarket Square which is a historical sight in the centre of old Cape Town  SA. Market House is a beautiful Art Deco building and walking distance from Cape Town's best museums  art galleries and manu attractions. The 24 hour doorman security guard makes one feel 100 safe. All should experience the energy and cultural inspiration of the Cape Town city centre and cultural hub at least once in their lifetime.  Thank you to Mr Connell Davids who was the perfect host - not only providing us with a lovely place to stay which was great value for money because it had everything one could possibly need washer  dryer  hair dryer  iron  ironing board... anything you would have at your house and even luxuries but he also gave us advice and guidance as he is a highly knowledgeable man who knows his city and its its history. Truly an inspiration area to stay in.
1653819,488858118109639497,2021-11-05,426880420,Buhle,I highly recommend staying here. A real hands-on host experience  great communication and you feel well taken care of. 5 stars almost feels insufficient.
1653819,510672723661210403,2021-12-05,103245202,Karen,We really enjoyed our stay at the Market house. Everything is within walking distance  and all the facilities in the apartment work well good wifi  nice shower etc. Communication with Connell was also quick and pleasant  and we could book on very short notice. There can be some noise from the square  but this always ended before we wanted to sleep.
1653819,524423896940247051,2021-12-24,330303290,Nusrat,Connell is a wonderful host who is hands on and easily contactable. He always had great tips on where to go and places to see. The apartment is neat and  cosy  as well as  centrally located close to restaurants and shops perfect for our needs. An added bonus was the performances in the market square that we could enjoy from the balcony. The music and bustling city adds to the atmosphere. A wonderful stay all-round. Definitely recommend a stay here.
1653819,529494318392459692,2021-12-31,427232463,Joshua,A great place with friendly but not too friendly  host

1653819,562802948270589778,2022-02-15,384299592,Chukwuebuka,The unit was clean and is close to some  the popular tourist area. The host also waited till night to help me with check-in since my flight arrived at night time. However the unit did not have airconditioning as was advertised prior to my booking. The host was upset that I had made a claim concerning this issue.

1653819,1095564352171580731,2024-02-20,126949810,Francisco,O flat  localizado numa regio central  prximo de supermercado  restaurantes  ponto de nibus do citysightseeing hop on hop off  lojas em geral e de um belo parque  onde vc pode fazer caminhadas no fim da tarde. Devido  localizao central  existe o problema da insegurana  por isso evite andar sozinho tarde da noite. Porm  h policiais na rea. Tenha muito cuidado com os batedores de carteira. O flat  espaoso com cozinha bem equipada e tem pequena varanda  com vista para uma feira de artesanato. O quarto tem duas camas com colcho de mola  o que  um pouco desconfortavel para dormir. No h ventilao natural no quarto  nem ar condicionado  o que o torna muito quente durante o vero. H um ventilador no quarto  mas no  suficiente para diminuir o calor. O proprietrio  muito atencioso e atende s mensagens rapidamente. Ele me pegou no aeroporto  no dia da chegada e me levou de volta ao aeroporto  no dia da sada  com pontualidade. Portanto  recomendo o flat do Connell.

I loved the location because it is central and there is a 24 hr security in the building. Right in front of the appartment was a very interesting market. Connell was so kind and responsive and always checked on us. Thanks again
1653819,1129582790359525460,2024-04-07,123928814,Will,Perfect place to stay for being in Cape Town CBD  if you want good value  simple accommodation to use as a base for being out and about each day  exploring everything that Cape Town and surrounds has to offer.  Greenmarket Square is a hive of activity  some good eateries within close walking distance  and Ubers in abundance mean a pick up is never more than 2-3 minutes away if you want to to further.
2013198,223942642,2018-01-02,3846284,Ulrica,Great location  a bit noise from the road but overall good. A special thanks to the lovely cleaning lady Sariana. We miss you already

2013198,408725098,2019-02-05,116980692,Kathrin,The apartment is beautiful. Its fully equipped  clean and the location is great.  I was planning to stay 7 weeks and Im sure I would have if there were better circumstances. The problem was that there is a big construction just next door really noisy. I booked it because of the garden to enjoy  but this was not possible. The biggest problem for me was the mice problem because of the construction. I bought a whole package of toast bread and in the morning there were only two slices left I didnt feel comfortable anymore. Like I said if this wouldnt have been  I would have stayed.
2013198,409950930,2019-02-09,170701280,Jessica,Wonderful home space full of character in the heart of the mother city. Highly recommended.

2013198,422525858,2019-03-11,173449630,Wil,Our stay at Kat's apartment was lovely. The apartment is walking distance to restaurants and very close to the Waterfront. The only downside of our stay was that we had to wait 2.5 hours before we could go into the apartment  after a 15 hour drive  as we could not get hold of anyone to come and open for us. Kat was out of town and there was no number to contact Rita. The apartment was equipped with exactly what was needed.
2013198,578599573,2019-12-18,138122442,Natascha,We had a wonderful time and felt more than at home for the month of our stay. Especially the living room of the apartment is spacious and was our favourite place. At the moment there is a construction building next to the apartment  but this didn't bother us very much as we did a lot of outdoor activities anyway. The communication with Kat worked great - she is a wonderful person.  Also the cleaning lady Sariana is stunning. You will love them both.
2013198,582032892,2019-12-26,47917356,Tandazani,Very central  neat and comfortable space. Kat is a great host.
2013198,588119516,2020-01-04,11578039,Stephen,Great host at a lovely venue. Location is perfect as a middle venue to explore Cape Town.
2013198,724306948,2021-01-15,13499832,Ramona,Kat is a very nice and friendly person. The flat is very stylish and perfect located. She took care about us and supported us if we needed something. She really cares. Thanks Kat for the great stay
1658671,286505005,2018-07-06,51826589,Leonie,Eugene and Daniele are the best hosts one may wish for. I had an incredible stay with them and will treasure my short stay with them forever. The accommodation is stylish  clean and very comfortable. The hosts went out of their way to make may stay a memorable one. I will definately return to this listing.
2013198,499806006546110126,2021-11-20,49731009,Julius,Thank you for the fantastic time in Cape Town. Kats apartment is perfectly located  pretty much between Green and Sea Point  with lots of Restaurants  Breakfast spots and bars just around the corner or a few minutes walk away. Her place has everything you would need  with a really cozy vibe and just felt like home for the days weve been in CP. Kat was super friendly and gave us lots of tips for things to see and do. Would always come back  so highly recommended 
2013198,532320924588172461,2022-01-04,122188699,Susan,Kat's apartmentis quirky  clean  comfortable and oh so convenientfor anyone wantingto enjoy the Atlantic Seaboard. You can walk to wonderful   treat your tastebuds at delis and bakeries. We especially enjoyed walking just across the road to the entrance of the beautiful Green Point Park and out of the other entrance at the lighthouse and strolling along the Promenade.
2013198,567843174476485853,2022-02-22,8791244,Sre,Wonderful apt in a beautiful complex with lots of green and pleasant neighbors. The apt is - apart from a TV we would not have turned on anyways - fully equipped with everything you need for your stay in Capetown. There are restaurants and stores nearby and a beautiful and safe park just across the street. Parking was not a problem as well. Though we didnt meet Kat personally  she was very responsive on WhatsApp.
2013198,683071755634623484,2022-07-31,91410289,Drikus,Great spot  very cozy. The neighbors in the building are quite nice. The space is quite lived in so it's easy to get comfortable. The fireplace is a huge boon during winter  especially considering the age of the building does translate to not so great insulation. We definitely enjoyed our stay there and would gladly go back again.
2013198,994119541263101842,2023-10-03,194395811,Kyle  Danae,Cozy house and great location  within walking distance of the waterfront and many nice restaurants and cafes. Kat was a great host  very helpful and accommodating.
2013198,1148456349709980414,2024-05-03,23479499,Mathieu,The accommodation is as pictured  with proactive instructions and plenty of recommendations  ensuring a fantastic and hassle-free stay in Cape Town The two unexpected elements for us two adults and two young kids were 1 the large garden not directly accessiblein sight from the apartment and 2 the reasonable noise from the road. However  despite these  I wholeheartedly recommend this centrally located accommodation. It offers a wonderful atmosphere that truly makes you feel at home  something that's quite rare on Airbnb.
2013198,1155729232208872143,2024-05-13,379557465,Grigorij,Thank you so much for this wonderful time at this beautiful place.
2015634,11466162,2014-04-04,2927777,Juan Daniel,Glenn and Marie were both excellent hosts and their groundskeeper  Solomon  was an awesome and helpful addition to the property. It's great people like them that made our stay in Camps Bay  Cape Town  that much greater. The bedrooms  living rooms  fully stocked kitchen and furnished villa are top notch and one of the best properties I have ever stayed in while on holiday. I highly recommend One On Houghton  in Camps Bay for any family or group of friends looking to stay in the area.
1666477,9381602,2013-12-25,9694859,Anna,I had a great experience while staying at Beverly's lovely home. It was actually a privilege to get to know her. She is a very skilled  generous and considerate host. She certainly understand the needs of her guests. She and her husband  Alan are a very special team. The studio is in a beautiful garden setting  well equipped and very comfortable. I needed internet access for professional reasons  and it was such a  relief to find a fast and reliable connection.  I would certainly not hesitate to return to  or to recommend Beverly's place to anyone.
1666477,10641788,2014-03-01,4039212,Paola,A lovely place  quiet and well-organized - we enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend it
1666477,10843735,2014-03-10,11822466,Miki,We enjoyed our stay so much The room was beautiful and comfortable  and Bev was a wonderful hostess.  Many thanks  Miki and Johan
1666477,13081969,2014-05-19,11892550,Erika,The accommodation was exactly as expected and perfect for not only an overnight stay like we did  but also for a longer stay. The room is elegant and squeaky clean very comfortable bed and plenty on offer for the continental breakfast. Beverley is a gracious host and communication with her was speedy and easy. She very kindly dropped us at Newlands rugby stadium and it was a nice  vigorous walk back to their place afterwards. We will stay here again.
1666477,13418992,2014-05-27,14129107,Tijs,We stayed for two nights at the largo guesthouse where we enjoyded the most hospitable welcome. Beverley was very friendly And gave us Some Nice do's And don't 's for our visit to capetown. Very clean room with everything you need. We even had a private parking lot wich ment We didn't have to worry About leaving our rental car. Overall a very positive expierience
1666477,18217959,2014-08-23,20140011,Susanne,Lovely accommodation with great view  close to nature but also short way to city center. Beverly was a lovely host. Would definitely recommend to family  friends. Thank you
2015634,27636674,2015-03-09,13994662,Philip,My friends and I 7 in total had a wonderful time. Location was just great with only a ten min walk to Camps Bay restaurants. The layout of the house is just perfect for up to five couples and it lends itself very well to entertaining. We had 40 over for a Braii one evening and it worked out really well. The pool is ok but like most in the area not for swimming in. Plenty of car parking spaces though we did not drive. Also very secure and in a great secure area. Wonderful caf at the end of the road for breakfast or lunch - really good. The house is perfectly wired for WIFI  music and TV and the kitchen is very well stocked. And then there is Solomon - a wonderful member of staff that just quietly goes about the house working away each day. We will definitely be back.
2015634,51422720,2015-10-20,27547328,Tony,We had a fantastic stay at this house. We had 9 adults and the house worked beautifully. Before we got there  I was a little worried that Camps Bay was too far out of town for a tourist  but it wasn't an issue. Great local restaurants and easy and cheap taxi to VA waterfront and other sites. The hop on and hop off bus also has a stop within a 10 minute walk. Solomon was the perfect host too incredibly welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommended.
2015634,62231956,2016-02-13,44675032,Rachael,Everything was amazing Highly recommend to stay here lovely location amazing villa. Solomon was a lovely surprise he was very welcoming and accommodating even did our BRAAI
2015634,63875010,2016-02-28,629252,Kathleen,Everything was fab - the house  view  location and Soloman We were a group of 6 and thoroughly enjoyed our time there....Glenn and Marie made us feel so welcome and the 2 bottles of wine  milk and water were very much appreciated Definitely recommend staying here
2015634,67418484,2016-03-29,21347410,Tamryn,Our stay was absolutely incredible. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. There is nothing we would change about the house or our hosts. Solomon was such a pleasure to have around. His friendly nature and kindness was so welcoming. I highly recommend this villa to anyone looking for a special experience in Camps Bay.
2015634,68280911,2016-04-04,43361938,Hannah,What can I say... This place is incredible We had the best time ever staying at one houghton. Glenn was the best host ever and so helpful  Solomon who is onsite to help with anything you need really made our stay amazing. Thank you for everything
2015634,72840999,2016-05-04,3778077,Negar,Stayed at this mansion of a villa prior to my wedding with a party of 10. Incredible experience  pictures are true to what you actually get  location is fantastic just steps away from a really good breakfast spot  private bathrooms for each room  top rooms have exquisite views of the ocean  everything is clean and in working order  laundry service  folding and ironing  and the best part is the super cute and friendly housekeeper who keeps the place immaculate. I can't say enough good things about this villa  just pack your bags and go Marie and Glenn are amazing as well and were accommodating in every way possible. Highly recommend this gem 
2015634,81504679,2016-06-23,21495150,Annika,We have celebrated our Wedding in Glenns House and we had a wonderful stay and unforgetable Wedding. The whole Family stayed with us in the House. It was the Perfect Location for the ceremony. Glenn always Supported us as much as he could  very fast answers in any case. Also the housekeeper Solomon was a big Support. He came every day and cleaned the whole House and helped us with any questions. We are very grateful for this fantastic stay
2015634,114373404,2016-11-18,81576922,Hans,Great place  and great service by Glenn
2015634,115811391,2016-11-26,46183054,Courtnie,15 of us stayed at Glenn's for a giant week-long sleepover in Cape Town and both the city and his home were stunning. We only would have liked clearer communication  for instance a book with emergency info and all-inclusive instructions on what we could and could not use or do within the house because we felt a little lost upon arrival. We also weren't aware that resident housekeeper meant that his male housekeeper was 100 live-in. As young girls who chose Airbnb in order to have a place with a little more privacy  we were weary about that  but all in all the housekeeping was a bonus and we appreciated the help.
2015634,120250614,2016-12-09,72552084,Kiambu,Great house Pictures are accurate and location is very convenient. Would definitely recommend. Glenn is very responsive and Solomon housekeeper is very gracious.
2015634,130040983,2017-02-04,19749050,Marcos,Glenn's house is a very good option to stay in Cape Town. Only a few blocks from Camps Bay's beach and restaurants. The house is huge  very well equipped and and the permanent presence of Solomon  the housekeeper  makes it stay clean and tidy always.
2015634,171866052,2017-07-19,88959811,David,The house was spacious and beautifully neat and clean.  Perfectly situated and Solomon kept everything organised and tidy.  He was great. We all had the best time together there.

2015634,221581276,2017-12-27,76407036,Cassandra,I am always nervous booking online and whether the actual will live up to the photos and description - we were not disappointed in this case The place is amazing  and so close to the beachshopsrestaurants of Camps Bay - we could safely walk there  The hosts were very helpful in their communications leading up to our visit  and the place itself is beautiful.  Highly recommend you definitely stay here
2015634,224431514,2018-01-03,31890816,Johanna,Great location - about 15 minutes walk from Camps Bay. Disappointing that the trees in Glen's yard are blocking the view from the living area.
2015634,233119793,2018-02-08,108251256,Shaun,Fantastic house  great location  and easy communication with the host. The house manager Solomon is a legend
2015634,238574207,2018-02-26,20414633,Chris,A great central location to Camps Bay.  Rooms were adequate.  Spaces are comfortable.  Extra touches with flowers  fruits etc were appreciated
2015634,601993975,2020-02-05,4040050,Ava,Glenn's place was perfect for our trip to Cape Town as a family. The location is amazing  a very easy 10 minute walk to Camps Bay's restaurants and beaches and a nice coffee shop right by the house. The views from the top balcony and main bedroom are stunning over Lion's Head and although the trees shade the views some around the pool  it makes the place feel very private. The common spaces were great  the pool is very small and was very cold so definitely just a plunge pool  but we didn't use it too much as we were out exploring. Solomon the housekeeper was very nice and considerate  helping to keep the house tidy every day  although I would say it made it slightly difficult to relax when I was up early with our little boy and it might be nice to discuss the preferredshortened hours of help ahead of the stay. However  we were very grateful all the same. The place was immaculate  very stylish and beautifully decorated. We'd come back again in a heartbeat  thank you
1666477,22742642,2014-11-13,21858784,Tom,Die Unterkunft war einfach nur perfekt. Schn und ruhig gelegen im schnen Newlands. Mit Bev und Allan zwei sympatische  offene und beraus gastfreundlichen Vermietern. Es waren gute Dokumentation in der Unterkunft vorhanden  welche es einem sehr leicht machten  sich in der nheren Umgebung des Quartiers zurerchtzufinden. Seien es Restauranttipps  Ausflugsideen und sogar zwei Joggingrunden. Kann Bev und Allan mit absolut guten Gewissen weiterempfehlen Unmglich  sich an 9  Largo Road nicht wohlzufhlen.
2015634,710478712,2020-11-22,353008762,Leo,Just as advertised
2015634,735099295,2021-02-28,270077268,Seraaj,What a great stay

2015634,723711126965242469,2022-09-25,68189994,Lynne,This is a very beautiful house  with an amazing view. We would love to come back.
2015634,794801345967918456,2023-01-01,23827561,Amanda,The place was absolutely beautiful.  Plenty of room for all of my family plus our own bathrooms.  The patios were wonderful.  However feeling safe in a place you are staying is worth everything.  Our third night there  somebody came into 3 of our rooms and stole all of the Ranz we had plus some items.  The windows appeared locked but were easily opened.  I tried to contact the host but he didnt respond.  The police came and were most suspicious of the housekeeper who lived on property.  The alarm system had gone off and the housekeeper called the security team off telling them we must have just got back from dinner.  No other properties were available so we had to stay the remaining 3 night is that house.  I was scared to let my teenage daughter sleep alone so she slept in my room the rest of the trip.  One positive is that once the host did respond he provided security in the evening.  Solomon  the housekeeper  remained in his quarters.  Please be cautious if you are staying here.
2015634,828859761369612474,2023-02-17,34118819,Emily,The house is spectacular  beautifully designed with incredible views over the ocean. Solomon the housekeeper took great care of us and was on hand in case we needed anything.
2015634,919379284013066081,2023-06-22,116065084,Babila,Wonderful place  close to activities. Could have used a heater  but overall great

2021476,849162206031432976,2023-03-17,240408890,Camryn Jade,Katja can come off a bit rude. She was also slow to respond and didnt really try to sort out our situation

Apartment is fully kitted out and all I needed was the clothes on my back and my phone to take pics of the beautiful view and the sunset right outside my bedroom window. Thank you Katja  I will never forget this experience.

Beverley was extremely welcoming and helpful with everything. We had a wonderful 2 nights and couldn't have asked for a better start to our Cape Town holiday
1666477,23880494,2014-12-13,24520954,Dylan,Beverley is a lovely host and has created a beautiful space to stay. So many thoughtful details like breakfast items and extras that make it all the more comfortable. Would love to go back Great area - safe and quiet  but nearby to Cavendish Square and easy to get to other parts of the Cape Town area.
1666477,24461703,2014-12-29,442998,Sara,La camera  composta da zona notte  bagno e zona cucina   confortevole  arredata con gusto e luminosa.

Beverly  un'ospite attenta a rendere il soggiorno piacevole e confortevole sotto tutti i punti di vista.
1666477,27430241,2015-03-04,12202057,Barbera,We loved our stay at Largo. The suite was wonderfully decorated and with attention for the little details  like fresh fruit  delicious muffins if they are homemade  I would love to have the recipe  yoghurt etc. on arrival  a extensive infomap etc. Bev is very welcoming  with useful tips but not intrusive. Plenty of towels and linen  great bed and shower. Would definitely stay again if I'd come back to Cape Town.
1666477,27549822,2015-03-07,27219941,Janco,The room was stunning  and much more than I expected. Situated on the bank of the Liesbeek River  at the foot of Table Mountain  this guest house is in one of the most scenic suburbs of Cape Town. Bev was very friendly  welcoming  and eager to tell me all about the area. I wouldn't hesitate to book this one again in future  and can honestly recommend it to anyone.
1666477,37014167,2015-07-03,36949615,Michelle,Beverly was a wonderful hostess and the room was absolutely lovely. What really sets it apart is the attention to detail - from hot water bottles to a lovely breakfast  Bev provided everything a visitor could possible want.  Highly recommended

The neighbourhood is peaceful and beautiful  and the room was clean and well-maintainedprepared. The attentiveness and care and recommendationssuggestions I received from Beverley and her family I would only receive from a friend or family. Beverley had kindly invited me to hikes  drives and coffee. She is very good with people and has a natural talent of knowing how close to get to them. I highly recommend booking with Beverley  and I would definitely book again at her's if I am to come back to Newlands.

The room is very nicely furnished and everything is clean  practical and well thought out with lovely views of the mountains from the window.

She is knowledgeable about the surrounding environs and city.    She provided great tips on places to visit and things to do  and not  to do .   Provided lots of great brochures and booklets about Cape Town and things happening in town.  Her booklet  that orients you to the property and surrounding environment is great. Lots of maps and mini reviews for shops and restaurants.  She even helped me get a cab when my alternative taxi app failed to work The room is as pictured and promised  with great views and a beautiful surrounding environment. Close to shopping  restaurants  public transport and everything you need but in a real neighborhood that is beautiful and close to all sorts of outdoor activities.

I had informed her that we're vegan and without hesitation she had ensured to amend things catering to our needs. For sure a great place to stay.

The place was clean  tastefully decorated  and had all that you would need or expect. Bev was great about giving you some nice things for breakfast and replenishing things when we ran out. Theres a nice little park across the street where you can take a scenic walk. Its also a nice neighborhood in a great location in the NewlandsClaremont suburbs of Cape Town. We will definitely try to book this place again for any future trips

2037869,10601838,2014-02-27,4192398,Christoph,Probably the best place to stay at when you want to discover Cape Town. Plus the unique Haas as an every-morning source of coffee  well-tasting calories and inspiration. Gideon is a wonderful host  had many helpful tips for us and gave us an amazing start into our SA vacation.
2037869,10682876,2014-03-03,1210580,Willem,Gideon is a sympatric laid back host and his house is great  both interior as also location wise. Close to the Waterkant best place to live in CT en only a few hundred meters from the CBD and nice places like Alexander Bar Bar and theatre This house also had a nice living room and a court yard and a stoep outside terrace along the street. In all  a fantastic place and I hope to visit it again.
2037869,12744666,2014-05-10,3371842,Aileen,The house is very comfortable and pleasant  in an interesting neighborhood   walking distance to many attractions.  Fantastic coffee shop on the corner--I had breakfast there every day.  Gideon was away during my stay  but his friend Fundiswa was there to transfer the key and she made me very welcome.  I would definitely recommend staying here for your trip to Cape Town.
2037869,13917112,2014-06-08,14402825,Kadhambari,Gideon was not available when I visited Cape Town however he made necessary arrangements so I could pick up keys from the neighbor. The neighborhood especially was amazing  the people were friendly and it is very centrally located and convenient to visit places from there.

2037869,22536806,2014-11-09,1516257,Nicolas,I very much enjoyed my stay at Gideon's place. The place is not too spacious  but I didn't mind that  since the interior design  furniture is very nice and the place has a great feel to it. Internet is fast in living room  kitchen available but slow in the guest room. Loved the bathroom. It's also very clean. Neighborhood is interesting Bree Street restaurants  Long Street bars  and Spar Market in Waterkant mall are all in 10 min walking distance. VA Waterfront is maybe 30 min walk  which I didn't mind given CT's spectacular views. Gideon was out a lot  but still accessible home on most evenings  on What's App. I had a conference so couldn't socialize too much but would have liked to hang out more. I broke a special wine glass when I had a visitor and felt terrible  but Gideon was very understanding. Sorry for drinking so much of the delicious Nespresso -
2037869,22753167,2014-11-13,1670484,Jens,Gideon was really nice and did all he could to make my stay pleasant. The house is in an excellent location for exploring the Bo-Kaap Cape Malay neighborhood  down-town area and probably the best bar-streets in Cape Town. And it's a safe area.
2037869,23520438,2014-12-03,6780410,Tom,A very nice house in a colorful special district very central located and a wonderful host I enjoyed more than two weeks at Gideons's house. The place is super comfortable  clean and safe. Gideon is an easy going very friendly guy. He cared even if we did not  see us very often through his job. I can highly recommend his house and I would like to come back. Servus Gideon

2037869,24279043,2014-12-24,24509450,Sini,Gideon was a very nice and helpful host  we felt very comfortable at his place. He was very responsive to any inquiries I had. The flat is very nice  furnished with good taste  neat and cosy  has an excellent location close to the city center and busy streets but is in a quiet neighborhood. The guest room is simple and clean  and comes with access to shared bathroom with superb bath tub  and a beautiful spacious  well equipped kitchen. Coffee in the morning in front of the house observing passers by was a pleasant start for any day. We had a car  and it was parked in front of the house on the street with no problems  of course one should be careful. The neighbors were really friendly and the location is perfect to see more of the special Cape Town quarter. Thank you Gideon for a nice stay in Bo Kaap

2037869,27426539,2015-03-04,5494488,Grit,I really can recommend the location as well as the host Gideon. Everything is very easy and perfect organized even when Gideon isn't at home. E.g. he offers you an optional arrangement of a pick up from the airport. The house is central but nevertheless in a very quite and nice location. We started most of our sightseeing by foot and especially in the evening there are so many hip restaurants and bars just around the corner. And when Gideon is at home he's open for a chat and has a lot of tips if you ask for. The room is clean and the bed very good. And the patio in the backyard is a perfect extra after an exhausting day.
